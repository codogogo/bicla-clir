Indeed, we must ensure that future flows of funding to Juba do not end up being used inappropriately or, worse, adding to the already widespread corruption.
I agree with the remarks that Commissioner Malmström made to this effect a little while ago.
It is my understanding, for example, that one of these companies was convicted in one region of Spain, and yet all it did was simply move to another region and continue its work.
One of the matters that concerns citizens is that they are not sure of how legal systems operate in other countries.
Thirdly, on equal rules: there should also be trust in the procedures, which must be clear and fair.
I would ask you, Commissioner, to understand that the word 'urgent' means 'now'.
Unfortunately, the Council has failed to respect Parliament once again.
When any member of the public contacts me in my constituency, I simply say to them to write back to the company and tell it to send all future correspondence to me.
Even though we have the 2006 directive, it is plain that it is not working as well as it should.
on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, I know the European City Guide best and, in spite of attempts to close it down, this menace continues.
The OFT does not have jurisdiction to tackle any scams from elsewhere, including from other Member States, so the problem continues and I continue to receive my share of complaints.
On that occasion, the Council endorsed the Presidency's conclusions on the progress made and the need to continue to work in close cooperation with all Member States towards a solution acceptable to all parties involved.
The Council will continue to monitor further progress in all areas since proper follow-up is an ongoing exercise in all Schengen countries.
In this respect, I can assure the honourable Members that both Bulgaria and Romania will continue to report regularly on the steps taken to remedy the remaining shortcomings.
When Parliament adopts the report prepared by Mr Coelho and the Council adopts the conclusions drafted by the Presidency, only the very last step - adopting the decision of the Council which, as we all know, requires unanimity - will be left.
In this respect, I would like to underline that the Council may return to this issue very soon to reflect on how it can further the process, possibly in September this year.
Only last week I received another letter asking: 'How can I defend myself?
But, of course, we all know that access to Schengen is also based on trust, and trust, or lack of trust, has been very much debated in the last weeks.
The decision to lift internal border controls with Romania and Bulgaria must not only be based on the technical evaluation but also on this trust, and unfortunately, that trust is not there today.
That is why it was so important, as the Presidency outlined, to work with Member States to find a swift solution to this so that borders could be lifted as soon as possible.
This creates legal uncertainty for the victims, as they often do not know what the legal status is of such contracts in another country.
The Council, which has the say on this, must define a clear framework with clear timetables related to border control so that Romania and Bulgaria can see a way forward.
Whilst the Commission has clearly stated that the directive on misleading and comparative advertising outlaws the misleading practices of these directory companies, it must also look at the transposing of that directive by the Member States in order to clarify whether citizens are protected equally across Europe.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed vital to know whether the directive on misleading and comparative advertising has been properly transposed and applied in the Member States.
In view of all this, this House should send an unequivocally strong message to the Council and, notably, to the permanent representations of five countries that I shall refrain from mentioning but which are in the minds of all of us here today.
I want to remind everyone that we are actually talking about very clear, specific criteria which any candidate country has to meet to become a member of the Schengen area.
We need a clear pan-European solution, but the European Commission, which holds the legislative initiative, has done nothing for years, despite all the efforts of the European Parliament.
It is not Romania and Bulgaria that are at fault because the European Union and certain Member States are unable to manage immigration and their borders, nor are they responsible for the extremist and populist deviations of a few governments, applying anti-immigration policies and regarding the mobility of European citizens, especially of Roma citizens, as a crime.
In reality, all the Commission need do is propose blacklisting these prohibited deceptive advertising practices under the relevant directive.
Conversely, there have been many instances of absurd judgments based on the formalistic approach taken by judicial and other supervisory bodies.
The Council's viewpoint that only some MEPs could have access and vote on a fully informed basis, while the others ought to raise their hands to copy them, was sharply criticised by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
Unless the state plays an active and not just a formal role, this problem will remain truly intractable and the petitions from defrauded victims will accumulate.
This is a feeling felt by many Member States with regard to the Schengen area and we should not rush with further expansion before all involved are fully and sufficiently ready and prepared.
Therefore, I hope that the Commission will tackle the root of the problem and take a systematic approach to resolving it as quickly as possible in the Member States where the situation is particularly bad.
However, as you, Mr Oettinger, have rightly said, Directive 2006/114/EC provides a legal basis for this which has obviously not been successfully implemented in some Member States.
Of course, I must stress that this debate should not be used as an excuse to criticise either Bulgaria or Romania, who we know have been working very hard to meet the technical criteria that the Commission has set.
Of course, because of the cross-border nature of the entries, the problem can spill over from these Member States into other neighbouring countries.
I have a whole stack of these cases on my desk and I admit that I would have fallen for most of them.
We find it unacceptable that several Member States have suggested, in the Council, changing the legal bases for the proposal so as to exclude Parliament from the decision-making process.
I hope very much that our rapporteur, Mr Coelho, will defend Parliament's prerogatives, as he always does very successfully, with our full support.
Firstly, in the event of cross-border problems, the law is often not even applied in many cases, as a result of the less than ideal cooperation between the authorities in the different Member States, and, therefore, these cases are not investigated at all.
For that reason, we have also supported the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, from the start in his view that the same standards must apply to all Member States, including when it comes to Schengen.
This means that we quite deliberately restricted ourselves on the basis of this directive to European regulation of dealings between fraudulent companies and citizens and not between fraudulent companies and small businesses.
Mr President, Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union states that verification, in accordance with evaluation procedures, that the necessary conditions for the application of the Schengen acquis have been met by the new Member States is an essential requirement for the Council to decide to abolish internal border controls with those States.
Finally, there are Member States which have satisfactory provisions under substantive and criminal law covering the relationship between fraudsters and citizens and which prosecute cases of this kind.
Commissioner Malmström may well idealistically muse how sacrosanct the Schengen acquis is, while the majority in Parliament may well drily consider how marvellous it would be if Bulgaria and Romania were to join the Schengen area, but it is just not realistic.
A review as to whether the corresponding Union law is effectively implemented by Member States is inevitable in order to avoid further misleading advertising and, if necessary, a new amendment of the relevant Union law should be proposed in order to solve the current problem.
At the same time, it is imperative to ask misleading business directory companies to cease and desist their deliberately misleading business activities, because they are contrary to the spirit of the Union's competition policy.
Both countries also have worryingly high scores when it comes to human trafficking.
You can want something to happen - you can want something to happen very badly - but you need to see the reality.
This is particularly important at the moment when there are internal challenges from and fears among our citizens about illegal immigration, which may threaten security and social advantages in Europe.
At present, I will feel less concerned if the Schengen area's Mediterranean border is guarded as well as Bulgaria and Romania guard their Black Sea borders.
For this reason, during the first stage, every operator of a nuclear power plant has been asked since 1 June to submit a report to the national authorities using the agreed European inspection criteria, our inspection catalogue, which is public and transparent.
I have to say that both the inspection report and the opinion of the rapporteur himself are positive, and that we should thank them, while, at the same time, also expressing our exasperation.
Exasperation over the way that some MEPs from countries which themselves have problems with illegal immigration and corruption are looking at Romania and Bulgaria today.
So, if you think about the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, and if we vote on it tomorrow, I would be delighted if you could view it in the same way as you view your own countries.
We will successfully achieve this because Mr Coelho's report is successful.
(PL) Mr President, I have the impression that in recent discussions in the European Parliament, we have been thinking increasingly in categories of defending ourselves along a Limes line - sometimes this runs along the European Union's external border, but sometimes we want to erect and defend borders within the European Union.
I want to say firmly and emphatically: there are no substantive reasons, today, to delay Bulgaria and Romania's joining the Schengen area.
The report I mention also makes reference to the visa liberalisation for the Balkan States, which was also something of an imprudent measure.
Please allow me to finish what I have to say.
I would like to explain to the honourable Member that this subject is so important that I should have at least seven to eight minutes speaking time.
By this I mean that deliberate attacks on nuclear power stations, perhaps by terrorists, in whatever form, including cyber attacks and attacks by aircraft, do not form part of the stress test.
In the event of a huge influx of immigrants at the border, specialist immigration and asylum mechanisms have been implemented in partnership with similar institutions in other Member States, Germany and the Netherlands.
Constant cooperation as part of the special mechanism set up by the European Commission has produced the results showing that Romania has the necessary institutional capacity required and political will to achieve the justice objectives.
Therefore, I can say as a Commissioner that I was surprised that restrictions were imposed on export bans by a clear majority.
In summary, this proposal is simply a border too far.
It is really starting to get on my nerves, to be quite blunt about it, that some Members of Parliament are constantly demanding more and more, but are not prepared to make a contribution themselves.
(HU) Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that by voting on the Coelho report tomorrow, the European Parliament will give a clear sign that it accepts Romania's and Bulgaria's readiness and supports the accession of these two countries to one of the most important acquis of the European Union, the Schengen area.
Six months ago, we would not have expected to have the opportunity to carry out a stress test of this kind.
It is easy to go around shouting about how dreadful everything is and focusing solely on the question of the exit from nuclear power, in other words, all or nothing.
I am not trying to say that everything is exactly how we wanted it.
Mrs Harms and Mr Turmes, it is simply not acceptable to spend your time permanently complaining and heckling and then, when you are called on to do something, to vote against better safety levels for nuclear power plants.
It is, of course, important for us to lay down stringent requirements for joining Schengen, but the same objective criteria must apply to everyone.
Now that all of the experts deem that Romania and Bulgaria satisfy requirements, I think it is clear that they should be allowed to join.
Of course the situation is complicated, but everyone is familiar with the legal position.
It is naïve to believe that we can do what we want.
There is a very specific legal position which we have to follow.
Today, we must welcome an important result, which is that we consider the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania to be among those who can benefit from this fundamental instrument.
The Schengen acquis is, therefore, a fundamental instrument for the legal economy, and I am convinced that on 24 June this year, the Council will take important points for reflection from what is intended to be a strengthening of trust and collaboration between Member States.
For me, it is highly regrettable that we are once again fighting over the question of yes or no.
(BG) Mr President, the SCH-EVAL Working Group described the one thousand three hundred kilometre Bulgarian border as a secure external border of the European Union, something which several Bulgarian governments worked for.
You know that I personally hold a very individual view on this issue but I have been prepared to compromise and to find common ground in Parliament in order to improve the safety of European nuclear power stations in their current locations, which is where they are likely to stay.
(DE) Madam President, Mr Reul, I take seriously your call for objectivity and honesty in our dealings with one another.
However, this is why there are foreign policy criteria and possible resignations from Bulgarian ministers.
However, you did not explain to Parliament that the only reason that this was not possible was because you, Mr Reul, and those on your side prevented it.
I want to welcome also the suggestions made by Commissioner Malmström yesterday regarding a new package of anti-corruption measures.
If we all want safety, then the right thing to do is to show a permanent commitment to safety and not just when there has been a core meltdown in three reactors.
(DE) Madam President, firstly, the reason why I reacted so strongly is that I am still annoyed that we have not managed to adopt a joint resolution on safety, because it was more important for some people to take up an absolutist position rather than to find common ground.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to congratulate my colleague, Carlos Coelho, who has done a masterly job on this report, and goodness knows it was complicated.
Madam President, I would like to say to Mr Reul that there was a time when power from unsafe nuclear plants was considered to be dirty and not to be bought by responsible EU states.
However, I believe that you are right when you say that not only must we deal carefully with the subject of the safety of European nuclear power stations, but that we must also take responsibility for influencing the construction and the condition of other power stations, in as far as we can.
(DE) Mr President, Mrs Győri, Commissioner, we are all aware that both of these countries - Romania and Bulgaria - have invested a great deal in securing the external borders of the European Union.
However, we are pleased to hear that the 143 European nuclear plants are going to be subject to the stress tests, and we also support the Commission in its efforts to persuade third countries to re-evaluate their plants as well.
Furthermore, we are not satisfied because we believe that stress tests, which, in fact, are going to be carried out by the operators themselves, should be subjected to a second opinion in order to ensure greater objectivity.
That means that not everything is completed with a single, one-off action but that confidence must be built over the long run; investment in security must be ensured over the long term.
I hope that this confidence remains secure over the long term so that we are able to maintain this freedom of travel, this freedom of movement within the European Union as a major public good over the long term.
I am distressed by something that I heard today, however, although it is something that I am unable to verify, namely, that police wages in Romania are to be cut by around a third.
We are conscious of the competition issues that have arisen but we think that a better agreement could have been reached.
I therefore hope that my information is inaccurate and that the police, who are performing a service in the interests of these countries and of the security of the entire European Union, will continue to be well paid in the future, too, so that they are not susceptible to bribery.
If a plant fails the test and if the issues raised cannot be remedied, it should be shut down.
However, these problems will not be resolved by not admitting Bulgaria and Romania.
The correct response ought to be to strengthen the principle of solidarity regarding emigration policy and to get all Member States to commit to applying it.
You said, Commissioner, that Schengen is an important gift for all European citizens, but it is also an important tool for not 'less' but for 'more' Europe.
That means that, no matter how high the standards of nuclear design and subsequent operation are, the quest for improvement should never stop'.
I strongly believe that the European Parliament will adopt this report tomorrow and that the Council will act accordingly as soon as possible.
That means that the industry must demonstrate to the regulator that it fully understands the hazards associated with its operations and knows how to control them.
In my opinion, Mr Coelho's report very much proves the opinion that these two countries are fully prepared and have fulfilled all of the conditions.
In my opinion, whoever meets the conditions should have the chance of becoming a member of the Schengen area.
As a Commissioner who is taking over a responsibility which he does not have, you should have said: 'Mrs Harms, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I have taken on a big task, but I have only made a small amount of progress'.
You should have admitted this and then I would have been able to take you more seriously.
At some point, there will be a sort of Oettinger seal of approval on the old reactors which will certify that tests have once again been carried out on paper of all the things that have often been tested before.
Therefore, following the events related to the Schengen area in Italy, France and then in Denmark, I think we have to send a very clear signal which says that no, the Schengen area is not under threat, we do not want it to be suspended, we want it to be strengthened and enlarged, and that we very much want Europe to be open.
Would you first of all accept that this is not just a German debate and that there are other elements to this discussion?
I would like to express my thanks to the Commissioner that when Denmark wanted to bring in border controls, a communication on common asylum and immigration policy was released very quickly.
Secondly, would you not accept that the circumstances faced by Fukushima were quite extraordinary and unprecedented, both in terms of the strength of the earthquake - the strongest ever experienced in Japan - and the height of the tsunami, which reached a maximum, I am told, of 46 metres, and had an average height of 14 metres, conditions that we might not expect in Europe?
If I were to say anything about Germany, it would be this: I believe it is right that the German Government, under the leadership of climate policy expert Klaus Töpfer, for example, has said that the risks involved in these power stations are too great, that in the case of a disaster, the risks would be unmanageable and that this is why Germany is getting out of nuclear power.
Secondly, I would like to say on the subject of Japan that TEPCO and other operators of nuclear power plants maintained before Fukushima that their plants were technically equipped to withstand all the types of earthquake that were likely to occur.
On top of this, in certain aspects, Romania can be used as a model of good practice, as indicated in the assessment documents.
Mr Oettinger was the only person who made the most of the opportunity to bring together everyone involved immediately after Fukushima and to insist that we carry out stress tests at a European level, regardless of the responsibilities.
(DE) Madam President, I remember very well a remark made publicly by Mr Oettinger who said that he knew that certain plants in the European Union would have to be disconnected from the grid as a result of the stress tests.
I am waiting for him to follow up on what he said.
I remember that Mr Oettinger said during the last plenary session that he would not sign the document that was currently on the table concerning stress tests.
Today, I asked a fellow MEP from a country which has a conflicting position on our accession to the Schengen area what reason he would have for opposing this.
I consider it obvious that the integration of Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen Agreement must be accepted by complying with the same rules that were complied with when other States became parties to the agreement.
Mrs Niebler knows why we failed and why we currently have no high, mandatory safety standards in Europe today.
That being the case, I have one question for the Commissioner: how does enforcement of the Schengen criteria fit in with general control under corruption policy?
I wish the citizens of Romania and Bulgaria the rapture that I personally experienced in chopping down the border gate on 22 December 2007, when Slovakia became part of the Schengen area.
Now, too, many Schengen countries conduct police inspections within the framework of national legislation, on flights inside the Schengen area, for example.
We must ensure that the highest safety standards are applied not just in Europe, but beyond its borders as well.
Technical readiness, as a result of the good work carried out by Bulgaria and Romania, is a positive finding, which is also being made by us today.
It must monitor and check whether this approach is mirrored in neighbouring countries, particularly those intending to build nuclear power plants next to the EU's external borders, and whether the provisions of international conventions are properly implemented or are little more than a piece of paper.
(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, in Austria, where you like to spend your holidays, we are doing very well when it comes to nuclear power plants.
Take a look at who really holds the power in important organisations such as the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG) and the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association (WENRA).
Austria, the country that is also your holiday destination, will give you the help you need.
This is the result of the general attitude and vision which the majority of fellow Members present in this Chamber have, which is that Bulgaria and Romania deserve to and must be part of the Schengen area.
The first thing I want to say is that some Members of this House need to show a little humility and a little common sense, because they make it appear that they are the only ones that have ever thought about nuclear safety and the only ones who are worried about the future of their children and humanity.
However, success in tackling these problems will only be achieved when all 27 countries combine their efforts.
This is why, speaking of stress tests, because some people do not want to talk about it, they only speak or discuss this in one debate or another with an undertone of eliminating nuclear energy, I have to say that Commissioner Oettinger has done an extraordinary job in a very short time.
Therefore, Commissioner, congratulations, we cannot have anything other than appreciation for you in how you have acted.
Now, if somebody is trying to change the rules of the game during the game, I think this might be illegal according to EU law and is, anyway, unfair according to common sense.
We also need to become much better in immediately assisting Member States which are in difficulties for one or other reason, and we need to clarify under what circumstances border controls might be reintroduced.
You have rightly said that several countries were not prepared to take part in a European inspection procedure.
But, in the meantime, we must recognise the enormous efforts that have been made by Bulgaria and Romania in order to comply with the technical requirements of Schengen.
The risk now and in future is not that an aircraft will accidentally crash on a nuclear power plant, but that there will be targeted attacks on these plants from outside.
There is the risk that we will not be able to do anything at a European level and that it will all come to nothing.
We then made efforts to encourage these countries to contact the candidate countries as well. As a result, I can tell you that there was a continuous dialogue behind the scenes in order for the parties to better understand and trust one another.
Will the Commission insist that all Member States conduct the stress tests properly, and do not do their own lightweight version?
On the other hand, I am convinced that the cooperation and verification mechanism - the famous CVM on which the Commission will release a report in July, dealing with the exact same issues that were voiced in this debate - could be helpful, even if officially, it is not part of the conditions for Schengen accession.
If you ask me about the general mood regarding any type of admission into the Schengen area, then we all know that it would be difficult to say that the European Union is currently in a particularly welcoming mood.
Several comments have been made in this debate that aptly demonstrate this.
I would like to be very clear: freedom of movement is a basic principle of the European Union, it is effective and valid, it is what our policies are built upon; this freedom is currently enjoyed by the Romanian and Bulgarian Roma population, just as by everyone else in every corner of the European Union.
Everyone can move freely, there are no visa requirements, and if anyone wanted to leave now, they could.
However, I am very proud of the fact that a Roma strategy was devised during the Hungarian Presidency which determines clearly the obligations of every Member State in connection with the community of this difficult fate.
In a country such as France, however, we also know that we will need 20 to 25 years to phase out nuclear power, and the latest studies giving the statistics on serious nuclear accidents predict that there will be an accident somewhere in the world within the next fifteen years.
We want to have real tests, and we cannot accept the fact that France has been successful in allowing the risky option to go forward.
And finally, since the ongoing evaluation of the Schengen system has been discussed at length as well, I would like to say that the Hungarian Presidency has already stated this very clearly from the first moment, and this is something we continue to believe in.
The problem must be treated at its roots: by providing better employment and education opportunities for them, this internal migration pressure will also decrease within the European Union.
(DE) Madam President, Mr Jadot, can you confirm that the joint resolution which we have drawn up on the subject of stress tests was initially signed by the chairs of your group, Mrs Harms and Mr Cohn-Bendit, who then opposed it in plenary, despite the fact that no major changes had been made?
Do you also believe that this was not very helpful to Mr Oettinger who is committed to introducing more stringent stress tests?
(FR) Indeed, Mr Liese, this resolution was co-signed, and I would also like to respond to Mrs del Castillo Vera who said that the French public is in favour of nuclear energy.
During the debate, one of our fellow Members said that letting Romania and Bulgaria join Schengen would be a childish decision.
Secondly, I would like to point out that stress tests should be established in all areas where energy is produced, if this whole approach to public safety is to be credible.
We know that not everything is as it should be with regard to Schengen.
Thirdly, I would like to say that the Commissioner seems to have embarked on a green pilgrimage, but the Polish satirist, Jerzy Lec, notes that even if you do go on a pilgrimage, you will still be smelly and you will still have sweaty feet.
Hence, I welcome the comments made by the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, who stated that he will convene a high-level meeting in Vienna on 24 June.
I hope that Council will recognise that when the assembly representing European citizens says yes with a large majority to Bulgaria and Romania, as I hope it will, the Council should follow suit as soon as possible.
(DE) Madam President, Mr Oettinger, in the bank stress tests, as we know, the leeway given was so generous that almost all the institutions investigated were able to come out of the tests relatively well.
Whenever a risk was suspected, a less thorough investigation was carried out, just to be on the safe side.
We have to presume that things may not be very different in the case of the nuclear power stations.
Romania and Bulgaria have proved once again, if there was ever any need for them to, that they are capable of adopting all the measures required to guarantee a significant level of security at the European Union's eastern border.
I firmly believe that once Romania has been integrated into the Schengen area, it will demonstrate to all Member States the serious and rigorous way in which it can guarantee the eastern border's security.
(LT) Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to discuss this important issue today, particularly as regards the European Union's neighbourhood.
The highest nuclear safety standards should therefore be legally binding and global, facilities everywhere should be equally safe, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should be strengthened.
The rules of the Schengen acquis must be the same for all countries and the assessment system must be based on the provision that rules should be met continuously, not only during accession.
Countries joining the Schengen area must continue to comply with all security requirements because the security of the Schengen area really depends on the rigour and effectiveness with which each Member State carries out controls at its external borders, as well as on the quality and speed with which information is exchanged through the Schengen Information Service.
Therefore, in order to remove controls at internal borders, it is necessary for the Member States to cooperate as much as possible and take the necessary action, particularly when increasing migration flows, because the security of the Schengen area depends on the rigour and effectiveness with which each Member State carries out controls at its external borders.
It is, of course, necessary to safely protect the external borders of the European Union, yet this objective is achieved not by keeping out Member States that are prepared but by introducing a continuous and transparent Schengen verification system, which - along with the common European migration policy and the refugee policy based on internal solidarity - represents a solution to many open questions.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, unlike the French Government, I sincerely hope we will have a major public debate.
If you believe this report, everything is shipshape and Bristol fashion and Romania and Bulgaria have demonstrated that they are sufficiently prepared to implement all of the Schengen rules.
These groups, and I quote verbatim from the Europol report 'are seeking to expand their interests in the EU, and may exploit opportunities in the possible accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen Zone'.
I would like to mention to you, Commissioner, the four principles that I think we should keep for a genuine control mechanism.
In this way, we will perhaps be able to bring about what Mrs Ek has called a European safety culture.
In view of the safety needs of all the people of Europe, particular attention should be given to making the appropriate use of all available means in order to raise safety standards and eliminate potential threats from nuclear energy.
It is not only power stations lying within the Member States which are a potential danger, but also those located in countries which are neighbours of the Union.
I would also like to underscore the profound need for additional investment, both in research into nuclear power and in other important research aimed at anticipating and combating accidents and their adverse effects in the future.
The European Parliament must adopt a position on principle, which is that the rules of the game cannot be changed midway.
I am counting on Mr Coelho's report being approved by a large majority to give a clear political signal to Member States.
(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, I am directly addressing the proposal you have brought before Parliament today and I will tell you totally frankly that I think some of us are entitled to be disappointed with this proposal, because the proposal being tabled is not just weak but also has huge gaps.
We know that it is not the case, and for this reason I very much hope there will be serious consequences and that we will be able to tell the public that we are taking care of their safety and not just pretending that we are.
However, I would like to point out that 13 EU Member States are already functioning without nuclear energy, including countries with successful economies such as Austria and Denmark, so we must be able to accept this possibility in Germany.
I would also like to say that Chancellor Merkel gave a government policy statement today in the German parliament and highlighted once again that we must at least make joint progress in the areas we agree on in Europe.
Proposals to this end have been made in the context of the Quality Package, including reducing the time for the Commission to scrutinise applications received to six months and reducing the objection period to two months.
If Fukushima has taught us anything, then it is, more than anything else, that we are unprepared for disasters, that we are unprepared for all sorts of things which could happen tomorrow and which, if they did, would have the gravest possible consequences.
But the Commissioner has put his finger on it in relation to a number of issues: first of all, the fact that there are some diverse standards; secondly, the long time that it takes from the time of application to actual registration.
We are worried, extremely worried, because the worst thing that could happen is that we carry out stress tests in the near future and get the kinds of results which will provide the perfect excuse for many of the operators of very old power plants, including those in the area where I live, to keep them in operation even longer, instead of closing them.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, we can only thank and congratulate you for having taken this initiative.
Unfortunately, I share the view of those who are particularly disappointed with the result, which represents a victory for the operators of nuclear facilities, for the safety authorities who have covered up what has been done for thirty years, and for the Member States who do not want to reconsider the choices that they have made, not just to keep nuclear power, but also the choices in relation to risk evaluation.
That is, we must review the question of how free the Member States are to block everything, as France has clearly done.
We must look again at the unacceptable issues in relation to responsibility - because, if the rules of ordinary law concerning responsibility were applied, we would not have these problems.
We must also look again at the application of rules of ordinary law concerning the right of European citizens to information, which, under present conditions, the system that has been introduced clearly does not safeguard.
(FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many fellow Members have already mentioned the drawbacks with stress tests: the fact that too much relies on their voluntary nature and, not least, how reactors would stand up to terrorist attacks.
If Parliament and the Council decide to adopt the Commission's proposals, almost one year - or ten months at least - will be saved for the majority of applications.
In that respect, I expect the European Commission to come up with a proposal.
In the interests of greater confidence, international inspections of the tests carried out will be undertaken and that is where I have a question.
How does the Commissioner intend to emulate the best practices of Germany, the Netherlands and Austria on an EU-wide scale?
As regards the Nuclear Waste Directive, I would say that we will have more opportunities than you have mentioned in your speech to discuss it next time, and I hope that the European Commission will take into account the proposals of the European Parliament because, in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, we have voted for several stronger proposals than were originally proposed by the European Commission?.
How would the citizens of major EU countries feel if a non-democratic country built an insufficiently tested nuclear power plant close to Brussels, Berlin, Paris or London, without consulting its public or sharing reliable information with its neighbouring countries?
Admittedly, the audit of the 143 nuclear reactors in Europe will, in the end, only relate to the 'Fukushima' scenario, and you have clearly set the limits for this, Commissioner.
It must not be the case as it has generally been in the past in the Council that the nuclear working group opposes anything which comes out of Europe.
(HU) Madam President, Commissioner, governments cannot deal with a more important task today than elaborating methods to deal with events occurring with low probability, for instance, the breakdown of cooling water or electric supply, and I agree with Mr Rübig in that this should not be a single event, but should be executed over a longer period of time and on a regular basis.
I also agree that we should extend this stress test in neighbouring countries, the countries east of our borders. This is why I ask the Commission to consider the possibility of how to execute a stress test in the context of the Eastern partnership.
I want to ask you, Commissioner, given that the school dropout rate has reached 16%, and even 40% in Portugal, how will the youth unemployment rate look in 15-20 years' time and what measures are you taking to ensure that this does not happen?
It is also important to stress that many actions are supported by the financial instruments of the EU, especially in this context, the European Social Fund, but I should also mention the new Microfinance Facility that provides programmes and, in the latter case, entrepreneurship and self-employment opportunities, and I think these dimensions have to be reflected in the forthcoming MFF proposal as well.
However, that obviously should not exempt the European Commission from its duty to continue badgering Member States about this and to maintain pressure on the national security services so that these services actually investigate whether the plants are going to be prepared for those risks, too.
We will have to take into account the probability that some of the 143 nuclear power plants in Europe will not pass these tests, that the weakest will go to the wall and that several plants will perhaps have to close.
It is clear, as Mr Leinen said a little while ago, that at that moment, a solution will primarily present itself at a European level.
The only thing that worries me is this false sense of security.
Let me emphasise once again that the Commission's approach is to reinforce Schengen, to improve the evaluation - as we already proposed before Christmas - to clarify the rules, to identify the tools, to assist Member States in need and, possibly, to introduce a mechanism which would bring a coordinated Community-based response to exceptional situations, for instance, when a Member State fails to control its internal borders.
We have now created an additional layer, but can you tell us whether we are eventually going to get an additional independent regulator, whose assessment will be supplemented by a second scientific opinion?
These controls could lead to recommendations to the Member States for immediate actions and deadlines for implementing them.
Our citizens are entitled to maximum security and it is time we removed this aspect from the Euratom Treaty.
It is important that the EU show concrete solidarity to the Member States most affected by large-scale inflows of migrants and persons in need of international protection.
(FR) Madam President, this debate got off to a bad start, with the good guys, the anti-nuclear people, on one side, and the bad guys, those who still support nuclear power, on the other.
Next, I would like to complain a bit about this debate, with its appeals to collective fear.
This is regrettable when we are dealing with a subject as important as this one.
Of course, we now have a large consultation process and we are under budgetary restraints, but you can count on me to ensure that there will still be money under this fund for the future as well.
Those Member States most exposed to migratory pressures and located at the external borders of the EU must receive adequate financial compensation for the tasks they are carrying out in the interests of the Schengen area as a whole - this by fair burden-sharing in order to support those Member States affected by large inflows of persons in need of international protection.
These tests are essential, because we have to make sure that our populations regain confidence in our nuclear power stations.
We can also see, however, that confidentiality is necessary in certain cases.
When it comes to combating terrorism, we cannot conceive of a Member State revealing strategic plans for combating terrorism in advance.
At the same time, however, as you well know, there are unanimity issues in the Council on the issue of Bulgaria and Romania.
However, I also believe that nuclear power should be part of our future energy mix.
In light of the summit, does this debate on the mechanism strengthen the perception of trust - I recall that, anyway, Article 23 of the Schengen Code makes provision for a mechanism for exceptional situations - or does it perhaps ultimately cause renewed concerns in the Member States and in all the States in the Schengen area?
Member of the Commission. - Trust can never be commanded, it has to be deserved and earned.
We can only try to improve the trust between Member States by having a more vigorous governance over Schengen; to make sure that we evaluate, not by the peer-review system we have today, but through an independent mechanism on a European communitarian basis with the involvement of the European Union in order to identify problems or weaknesses in the Schengen system very early on and also make sure that we have tools at our disposal to immediately assist Member States that are in difficulty.
None of us would like this to be repeated in Europe, just as no one would like a repeat of Chernobyl.
We must do everything to make Europe safe and restore confidence in this source of energy.
All this demands a lot of political will and some extra resources, and I will do my best to fight to make sure that there are resources under my responsibility.
These have shown that there is a lot of progress, but there are still some things to be done, and we are in dialogue with the Kosovo Government in order to help and assist them to do these last things.
That route, at a time when there is a lack of alternative sources, will lead to jumps in electricity prices.
I just wanted to ask whether you think it is possible that this mission could still make it to Kosovo this year, or is that something that you really could not judge?
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to point out to you that, at its international meeting in Kiev on the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl, the Institut de radioprotection et de sûreté nucléaire stated that a serious accident would take place in Europe within twenty years, hence the importance of the stress tests and of enhancing the security and safety of reactors.
(SK) Madam President, I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation for the way that the European Commission, in launching a transparent review of all 143 nuclear power plants in the European Union, has acted swiftly to assuage Europeans' concerns that the large number of nuclear power plants throughout Europe could be a risk to them.
I am confident that the data from the stress tests will prepare us for a new round of talks on this issue, where we will discuss a new safety policy for the European Union in this field.
First of all, however, if you are concerned that a watered-down stress test will turn into a seal of approval without the necessary objectivity, I can assure you that I will do everything possible during the months to come, together with my offices, to ensure that this assumption is unfounded.
This is currently a concern which I completely understand, but some Members also have prejudices.
We have the working group between the EU and the United States, created last November, where we have had a series of different expert meetings.
Secondly, if we assume that the outcome of the stress tests will not be a placebo and that the seal of approval will not be handed out randomly, but instead that the tests will be constructive, critical and objective, then I believe that these stress tests will bring many benefits and that the alternative, not carrying out any stress tests, would be a worse solution.
It is for this reason that we need jointly to get our systems in order and share intelligence in order to attack this issue.
If there is reason to believe that organised crime groups are behind more and more crimes on the Internet, the same investigative measures applied in the detection and prosecution of offline organised crime should be applied, coupled of course with an improved coordination mechanism.
I would like to explain once again, Mr Turmes, that if I had not signed the revised and, in my opinion, positive version of the test criteria, we would now have nothing.
I understand that there are people bragging and conducting so-called criminal business on the Internet, and that gang business includes drug trafficking, human trafficking, prostitution, weapons trafficking, smuggling illegal immigrants across borders, even murder, theft, fraud, armed robbery and much more.
Mr Turmes, if every Member of this House were as noisy as you are, there would be chaos in the Chamber.
The Commission is suggesting a dominant lead for itself in a revised Schengen evaluation process, and Parliament proposes to modify that in order to allow a balance between the role of European and national experts.
The reintroduction of border controls within the EU does not provide a solution to migration and will, on the contrary, make life more difficult for European citizens and lead to a nationalistic outlook.
In view of this and the statement by the EP President to the effect that freedom of movement is perhaps the aspect of the EU most appreciated by Europeans, what position does the Commission intend to adopt with regard to Denmark following its recent decision to reintroduce border controls?
All 14 Member States have voluntarily opted to become involved, which is a big success for the European Parliament.
If there are serious problems with a particular nuclear power station, the citizens of Europe and of the relevant Member State will call for the necessary measures to be taken.
The Commission will continue to make sure that the Schengen rules are correctly applied and respected by everybody.
We are currently considering whether and how to complement this evaluation mechanism in order to create mutual trust and ensure a coherent application of the rules.
Regarding the Danish Government's plan regarding controls on the Danish internal borders, which Ms Koppa referred to, you will, of course, be aware that the President of the Commission wrote to the Danish Prime Minister immediately, pointing out that the first analysis by the Commission raised major doubts about whether the proposed measures would be in line with Denmark's obligations under European and international law.
Ms Koppa also asked whether the Commission will propose a revision of the principle of exclusive responsibility of the state of first illegal entry.
However, at the moment we simply have to accept that the government in power in Minsk has no policies, no transparency, no democracy and no concept of safety.
It is therefore not an instrument designed to respond to the challenges related to irregular migration.
The Member States that play the biggest role in the applicant's entry into the EU should be responsible for examining his or her application for asylum.
Commissioner, I am, of course, very glad to hear you stress again the importance that you attach to the maintenance of the Schengen area.
I know you are very sincere on that, but my worry is that, despite that, people seem to have got the wrong end of the stick and the impression has got abroad - for instance, last week an article in the Financial Times said that 'Schengen as well as the eurozone was disintegrating' - that somehow the Commission is fairly relaxed about the reintroduction of internal border controls.
Be that as it may, I should like to point out on the question of the Dublin II Regulation that, for certain countries today like my country, Greece, which lie on the external borders of the Union and actually receive approximately 90% of immigrants who land in Europe, the Dublin II Regulation is unacceptable; it is not something that local populations can accept; it is not something that the countries can accept.
Secondly, as regards Dublin II, I should like to point out the following, to add to what Mrs Koppa said.
The Sellafield station is very close to Ireland and there have been many accidents there to date, and therefore I am asking the Commission to put pressure on the British authorities to stress-test the station because it continues to be a risk to the people of Ireland.
Neither Russia nor Belarus have conducted environmental impact assessments on these power plants in accordance with generally accepted international standards, as called for in the Espoo convention, to which all EU Member States are signatories.
I believe that the construction of these nuclear power plants next to the borders of the EU can pose a threat not only to EU Member States, but also to the entire continent of Europe.
The Commission has proposed keeping the responsibility of the first country of asylum in the Dublin Regulation, but also reintroducing an emergency mechanism in order to suspend that mechanism under special circumstances.
In parallel with putting the asylum system in place for the whole of Europe, which would also lead to greater burden-sharing - because if all Member States have a system that works, all Member States could receive asylum seekers - the solution for Greece is to continue with the reform plans that are being implemented under the action plan in Greece.
They will die prematurely because Europe will give up using nuclear power and replace it with fossil energy.
A number of votes and declarations have proven that there is consensus within the EU on various aspects of this fund.
The European Commission must include neighbouring states as well when carrying out the stress tests, applying to them the same test criteria established at EU level and taking into account the cross-border nature of the possible effects of nuclear energy.
This is why I think that the following points should be borne in mind when carrying out and assessing the stress tests:
On the basis of experience gained with the Fund in its present form and suggestions made during consultations, we have great hopes that our proposal will significantly improve the fund after 2013 and will, in particular, solve two problems with the current mechanism for financing.
The European Commission has confirmed on several occasions that some neighbouring countries - Ukraine, Russia, Sweden and Turkey - are ready to join the European stress test programme, but it is still unclear what specific action the Commission intends to take to bring about cooperation, and how the situation will pan out with regard to Belarus.
This has made it increasingly difficult to identify sufficient margins from which to draw contributions.
I am sure you will agree that this is not helpful to workers who have been made redundant and need assistance quickly.
With this in mind, I am pleased that, in Paris two days ago, there was agreement on the need for all countries using nuclear installations to implement safety audits in order to assess their capacity to withstand incidents which, up till now, have been considered 'unlikely'.
I should therefore like to put on record, in addition to my own disappointment, my wish that Parliament's Bureau write to the Brazilian authorities declaring the disappointment of the entire European Parliament and, above all, expressing our solidarity and our grief to the families of the victims, who have been waiting for justice for thirty years.
This means that as the procedures are revised, we will oppose the idea of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) becoming just another instrument, for example, an instrument of the cohesion policy, because that would mean that all the EU's money apart from funds put aside for foreign policy or research and development would belong to the cohesion policy.
I believe that the whole of this House shares the disappointment and the profound bitterness at the decisions that have been taken, and therefore I can only repeat what Parliament has already made clear on this issue on at least two occasions.
(IT) Mr President, I only need a few seconds to send my good wishes to Mrs Weisberger, who has recently become a mother and who is present here with her baby girl, as well as to all new mothers in this House, those who will become new mothers and those who, like me, work hard to be good mothers and good parliamentarians.
I did have a question for the Commissioner further on, which we will not get to tonight, and which did indeed ask for his view on the merging of the ESF and the EGF, on which you have spoken but did not give us an opinion.
Since we very often find ourselves legislating on the work-life balance, it is truly absurd that remarks of this kind are made in this Chamber, and even more so when they are made by women.
As I pointed out, some questions remain open, such as the relationship between the EGF and the ESF.
I would also like to thank the Declaration Office and my staff, whose hard work made our job that much easier.
Of course, even now, and probably also in the future, various Member States will find it possible to fund programmes either from the EGF or the ESF and have some kind of room for manoeuvre, but it is very important just to keep the EGF available for all Member States in case there is a need to respond to sudden employment crises.
Mr Aylward, I did say before you came in that we had 20 minutes per Commissioner, which would mean that we could possibly get to Question 15 by Mrs Blinkevičiūtė, but I am afraid I do not think we are going to make it to yours.
In a previous parliamentary term, when Mr Bütikofer was not yet a Member of Parliament, a penalty was imposed on the chair of a group because he voted on behalf of his neighbour.
However, Article 51 of the Charter states that its provisions are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, and to the Member States only when they are implementing EU law.
These issues therefore fall exclusively within the remit of national law, with due regard for the relevant international obligations of Greece, including the relevant conventions of the International Labour Organisation.
(EL) Commissioner, I am sorry, but once again, you have not given a clear reply.
(IT) Mr President, Sudan is the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa, the crossroads at which the Arab and African worlds meet, as well as a mosaic of a great many diverse ethnic groups.
I should note, however, that intervention in this country remains a priority for the European Union.
We must avoid the situation in which future funding flows to Juba end up being improperly deployed or, even worse, feeding the existing high level of corruption.
I am not saying that all the questions have been answered and that is exactly why I took the initiative of organising a conference on wages and wage setting in the EU.
We all know that the situation around the Horn of Africa is extremely sensitive, we know that there are problems with the democratic traditions, we know that the situation of women is incredibly difficult and we know that there are problems with pirates.
In this context, I would also like to emphasise how important it is that people are able to exercise their human rights and are able to talk and demonstrate freely.
This goes for the whole of the Horn of Africa and not least for the Swedish citizen, Dawit Isaak, who is imprisoned in Eritrea.
Our task as Europeans is obviously to support democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion, all of which are core values.
As you know, 1 May 2011 was an important date for the EU.
That opens great opportunities for the individual, who can move where there are jobs, and also for the economy.
But we are also aware that, despite the large body of EU legislation in the area of freedom of movement for workers, most EU citizens still feel there are too many obstacles to working in another Member State.
In Russia, they obviously have to ensure that the dual identity that people could buy there previously can no longer be obtained.
Tackling these problems calls for a broad approach, combined with effective implementation of the principle of free movement.
I am not talking about negotiations with Russia on Belarus, as this would only imply that Russia has some sort of 'special rights' to this country.
It is important to point out that, for the current funding period, 2007-2013, the resources under the heading of the structural funds have already been allocated and agreed with the regions and the Member States within the framework of the more than 400 operating programmes.
If we can ensure that the cooperation is friendly, but also serious, and if we do not forget to make legitimate demands and highlight legitimate failings, we will be making a step in the right direction, not only in terms of the cooperation between Europe and Russia, but, most importantly, in terms of human rights.
This is one of the priorities of regional policy, which is also implemented in the form of tailor-made proposals in several of the roughly 400 programmes that I referred to earlier.
We also know that there are many people in prison precisely because they have tried to exercise their human rights.
Likewise, I think the choice of words with regard to energy policy is far too feeble.
You have now had quite a lot to tell us, all of it correct.
I am sure you have experience in this area.
Once again, my question is, are you personally prepared to really get this fast-start funding specifically, which everyone is saying that we urgently need, off the ground and not merely implement what your predecessors decided?
That is why I also gave you a very specific answer based on the rules that we have in the field of regional policy.
Personally, I would want the resources already in place to be used for this, and I would be pleased if that were the case.
(IT) Mr President, while researching this subject, I realised that, paradoxically, given the size of the country, this is a question of particular concern in Switzerland, where there is a great deal of information and there are very many publications on the matter, whereas there is much less information coming from Europe.
As the expansion of renewable energies does indeed represent one of the focal points of the Europe 2020 strategy, I assume that, in the forthcoming period, there will definitively be a higher budget for this area, including from the regional policy heading.
Faced as we are with well over 400 petitions, as stated in a paragraph of the resolution, we find ourselves discussing this issue again in this Chamber.
If, today, regions are seeking to re-dedicate resources in addition to the resources already available, we are certainly very open, in this area, to the idea of opening up this opportunity or, in any case, to holding serious talks in this regard.
My vote in favour this morning was therefore intended principally to benefit small and medium-sized enterprises, which are great contributors to our economic system.
If you reply to the wrong letter and fill out the wrong form during this period of founding a company when you have a lot of work and a great deal of red tape to deal with, you will find that you have signed a contract and are faced with a bill for up to EUR 1 000.
There is a rule that says that, given a certain sliding scale per Member State, only a specific sum measured by the overall GDP of a Member State is available for structural policy.
Instead, they are pursued by debt recovery agencies without being able to put a stop to it and without being able to report or get hold of the person responsible for the crime.
The auditing by the Court of Auditors in respect of budget implementation always only considers the year in progress, and for that reason, methodological challenges result as, in relation to regional policy, the third audit level applies, while the annual audit by the Court of Auditors already takes place under the first audit level and therefore, a higher error rate will always result here than at the end of a programme cycle, as we can prove already.
In any event, my predecessor, Mrs Hübner, also put in place an action plan together with Parliament in this regard, the efficacy of which is already evident and which has shown its effect.
When it comes to the error rate, however, I would also ask you to always take into consideration that regional policy has, if you like, a kind of snowplough function in this connection, that, in relation to certain statutorily developed elements, we check how they are implemented in day-to-day practice, how effective they are and what problems result.
If we succeed in simplifying this system - and we have launched an initiative to this end together with Commissioner Barnier - we will also reduce the practical error rate in this area, too.
Mrs Jensen, it is our stated goal in the next programme period to thematically tie in structural policy - insofar as it is affected, in any case - with the Europe 2020 strategy.
For years since I have been an MEP, I have been receiving letters and e-mails from constituents who have inadvertently been misled into signing up for a business directory, then being invoiced for a rather large amount of money.
Parliament is taking the political initiative in Europe's budget for the first time.
Given that defence of the principle of the self-determination of peoples and protection of Christian minorities in the world are both fundamental features of Lega Nord's political theory, I can do no other than show my support for this resolution.
As the EU is an undemocratic institution itself, and one that I strongly believe should not have a foreign policy agenda, I cannot endorse any third country activity by it.
It is essential that foreign aid and foreign policy remain the remit of individual Member States and is not dictated at EU level, even if the recipient is in need and appropriate.
Such activity at EU level paves the way for increased competence with regard to external action, which is something I strongly disagree with.
Given the results of the referendum, the will of the people of South Sudan is now unequivocally in favour of independence, as has been repeatedly reiterated for many years now.
This period of crisis and rescue plans may be the worst possible time for starting negotiations on the financial perspective, but for all those of us who believe in the EU budget as an instrument needed to transform 27 Member States into a true Union, the challenge is before us, and our sights must be set high enough to tackle it.
The current situation, with the conflicts experienced in Sudan and in the whole region breaking out again, and the dispute over establishing its borders, demonstrates that the artificial creation of this country does not resolve any of the existing problems, nor will it improve the standard of living of millions of Sudanese people, but rather it will stir up contradictions and conflict.
After the great imperialist powers have finished carving up the African continent in their own interests, everything points to the belief that a process has been restarted in South Sudan which will lead to more wars and suffering for the already severely devastated populations of Africa.
In relation to the question of the future financial perspective and its organisation, the kind of Europe that we want is becoming evident.
However, one can also say that Europe is our answer, as a 21st century continent, to the economic, environmental, financial and migration policy-related challenges in a globalised world.
(NL) Mr President, given his extremely negative reactions to the position of the Dutch Government, I would like to ask my esteemed fellow Member whether he still recognises at all the democratic right of EU Member States to voice their own opinions on behalf of their citizens.
As this motion for a resolution clearly meets these requirements, I have voted in favour of it.
I only hope that you also recognise that the position of the Dutch Government cannot simply be handed down ex cathedra, but that it should be debated in a multinational democracy.
Colleagues, I think that means that we have a very good draft SURE report here today!
I have to tell you that beyond the three or four words saying that Her Majesty's Government is disappointed by the report, the other parts of the letter are a real provocation: a provocation to Europe and the European Union, because their main point is that no increase in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is possible, and that we have to stick to the old MFF, the same figures, the same resources, naturally the same rebates, and certainly the same rebate for the UK.
If it wants to make savings in Great Britain, it can do so in the research sector simply by adopting the European patent immediately.
The resolution contains the correct recommendations addressed to the European representatives who will be taking part in the summit, reminding them that the EU must exercise its political power to persuade Russia to assume its share of the responsibility for solving the problems that afflict the world today in the political, economic, geopolitical and environmental sphere.
on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, if I may take this opportunity, speaking on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, I want to respond to Mr Verhofstadt who, as ever, has missed the point and who, as ever, is facing in the wrong direction.
All over Europe, governments are imposing austerity budgets, and this House would be exceedingly unwise if it does not take on board that message, if it chooses to ignore the letter from the five Heads of Government, because what those five Heads of Government were saying is: more Europe is not the answer; smarter Europe is.
So we accept that there should be increased expenditure on the new priorities but we also think it was time we looked again at the traditional priorities, so here again, it was another missed opportunity for the European budget.
For Russia, European scientific and technical progress has been emulated since the time of Peter the Great, but it has simultaneously been feared as something that could potentially destroy the Russian soul and way of being, and viewed as a threat to its territorial integrity.
It is in this context that we must view the pressure put on Russia (which also occurs with several other countries) to join the World Trade Organisation, in order to promote 'a level playing field for business communities on both sides' and 'liberalise trade in the global economy', while facilitating foreign investment and renouncing any 'protectionist measures'.
We must remember that Romania, a member of the EU and NATO, has expressed willingness to host this system, which constitutes a threat to Russian security and to peace in Europe.
Here, too, the tone of the debate is as if the money which goes to Brussels is disappearing into a black hole.
The majority of the European Parliament is once again expressing its now standard neoliberal and meddling position on relations between the EU and Russia.
The latter means that more money will have to go to the EU for that EU embassy, but it also means that 27 times less money is spent in the 27 Member States.
Not even the United States has given any assurance that it does not.
I believe that, if appropriate action is not taken to remedy this situation, the EU's influence could slowly wane in both Russia and its neighbouring countries, with the risk that the Union would see its role restricted solely to that of a trading partner.
Of course, we must not forget and we cannot ignore various important issues, which continue to hinder the development of valuable relations between the EU and Russia, and especially, moreover, the fact that nearly three years after the war in Georgia, Russia continues to occupy a large part of the sovereign territory of Georgia, continues to ignore the agreement concluded in 2008, and fails to ensure proper access to these territories by the European Union Observer Mission.
Today, the European Union is unanimous against the Russian policy of stirring up frozen conflicts and Moscow's attempts at interfering in the politics of independent states which were formerly part of the USSR, such as Georgia.
Finally, I would like to put the following question to those Member States which are saying that less and less money should go to the EU, but which, at the same time, are giving all kinds of new priorities to the EU: if you want less money to go to the EU, what are the priorities that we as the EU should work on?
So far, we have heard that there are more and more priorities, with less money.
The common fisheries policy - deemed a failure by Commissioner Damanaki - requires taxpayers to send EUR 1 billion to Brussels every year.
It is also necessary to raise the question of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Russia, which is, after all, a member State of the Council of Europe.
Let me make it clear: a right-thinking Member State such as the Netherlands will never be able to agree with this report.
My group want the lamps to stay on in Europe and, therefore, we will vote wholeheartedly against the report.
(NL) Mr President, I would like to ask my fellow Member Hartong the following question. At present, several EU Member States are members of the G8, the organisation of the eight largest economies in the world.
Europe includes a number of states that have come from the same mould and this should be taken into consideration when examining relations between the EU and Russia.
Do you not think that the only way Europe can really continue to play a role there is to act together?
This is a real contribution to the preparations for the next financial perspective, but it is also truly European.
in writing. - The EP: regrets that, contrary to Russia's obligations as a member of the Council of Europe to uphold freedom of assembly, peaceful citizens' gatherings continue to be banned and violently dispersed, including a gay pride march in Moscow for the sixth consecutive year, disregarding a final ruling made in April 2011 by the European Court of Human Rights; expects EU delegations and diplomats to actively implement the Toolkit to Promote and Protect the Enjoyment of All Human Rights by LGBT People in the future.
I believe that focusing on individual disadvantaged groups in society, as this paragraph does, is inappropriate.
Traditional does not mean outdated, but as a mechanism for delivering the goals of the 2020 strategy.
The first part of the paragraph means for me that the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people can be protected, without losing sight of other groups, in order to ensure equal treatment.
As the current directive on misleading practices has turned out to be insufficient, I voted in favour of this resolution calling on the European Commission to speed up the revision of this directive so that such misleading practices can no longer take place.
I have supported this initiative as the Commission must ensure that Member States comply with Directive 2006/114/EC on misleading and comparative advertising, which applies to business-to-business transactions.
There is one but, however: we live in a time when all Member States are turning over every euro at least three times before spending it.
Regrettably, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, which applies to business-to-business transactions, fails to provide a sufficiently effective remedy or is inadequately enforced by Member States.
However, at the same time, it must be said that all regions must have access to cohesion policy, both Eastern European Member States and strong national economies like Germany.
in writing. - I voted against the motion for a resolution on misleading business directories as the UK operates its own misleading marketing regulations via the Office of Fair Trading, which controls the regulation of open and honest trade and contracts within the UK.
As regards misleading practices in business directories, which are common and have a disastrous effect on businesses, I consider it a good sign that the relevant legislation is being overhauled so as to put an end to the misleading practices used by publishers of business directories, namely through the creation of a blacklist of misleading practices used by business directories.
Regrettably, not only is Directive 2006/114/EC on misleading and comparative advertising failing to obtain the hoped-for results, but the victims are, in particular, elderly individuals, small and medium-sized businesses and even charitable organisations.
Moreover, there is no blacklist of these fraudulent companies, such as would help to prevent their practices, which meanwhile continue with the knowledge of the national authorities.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report is a proper, reasonable offer by Parliament to the Commission and Council for the further development of the budgetary basis of the European Union in difficult times.
However, I do not think we need to create new legislation.
We must tell the Council clearly that if it refuses to take the path indicated by us today, it needs to indicate which political priorities are to be struck off the agenda and no longer financed.
This is required if we are to be honest with our citizens.
I hope that the Commission will respond positively to these suggestions from Parliament in its legislative proposals and I expect that the future presidencies will find a way to communicate openly and transparently with Parliament, so that we can complete the assent procedures in the appropriate timeframe.
The fact is that I am not just a member of the Christian Democratic Union, but have also been Vice-Chair of the CDU in Schleswig-Holstein for 13 years.
The statement on own resources agreed by the CDU/CSU Members of the European Parliament, which, to a certain extent, contradicts the party's national position, is completely at one with the findings of the Policy Changes Committee.
Parliament continues to receive petitions and complaints about business directory companies.
I am sure that we are all in complete agreement as to the challenges that we face.
On the other hand, 5% is very little when we consider the challenges that the EU is facing, and when we know only too well that the EU has actually been given a number of new tasks that it really ought to take care of properly, and we cannot do that without funds.
Our credibility will then increase significantly if we manage to show that we can also reallocate/reprioritise and save money before we ask for more.
However, the measures should be directed not only at the business world and not only, as in the specific case covered here, at the misleading commercial practices of directory companies.
Now, I am talking about unjustified advantages within agricultural policy as well as the fact that our anti-corruption policy is, to a large degree, not as successful as we always claim it is, and the fact that, to a certain extent, the EU's administration is rather unwieldy - the very fact that we are here in Strasbourg is an example of this.
However, we have not always been entirely successful in doing this in this report, which also explains why some of my fellow Members will be pressing the 'no' button, or perhaps the 'abstain' button, in tomorrow's vote, even though a large majority of our group supports the report.
In order to stop such dishonest activities as soon as possible, the Commission must compile a blacklist of misleading practices by business directories and adopt relevant legislation, focusing, in particular, on the provisions of the directive on misleading and comparative advertising and the implementation of these.
However, this does not mean that we have not noticed the document's weak points.
in writing. - I voted for this motion for a resolution because it has clearly pointed out the current situation of misleading business practices, which are already against EU law, and that the international dimension of the fraud makes it difficult for the victims to pursue and fight against the fraudsters.
I believe that vulnerable small businesses and professionals need to be protected from the misleading business directories, and thus the EP and the EU as a whole must show that European law is there for everyone to follow and respect.
However, in view of the results that are now known, the Commission must be urged to supervise the implementation of Directive 2006/114/EC and, at the same time, to test its limits with a view to its improvement.
Recalls that, although the Commission has no power to enforce the directive directly against individuals or companies, it does have a duty to ensure that the directive is adequately implemented by Member States; 3.
I do not believe that this can be achieved from your position, Mr Ashworth; instead, I would back Mr Böge, who I believe is correct and faithful to the Treaty when he says that we need to have the courage to return to a system that involves what are genuinely our own resources.
The number of complaints which Parliament has received concerning misleading business directories and the fact that they are often cross-border in nature demonstrate that there is a need to improve EU regulations in this area.
That is why I believe Mr Verhofstadt is right when he says that we must, of course, be prepared to take up joint initiatives such as the establishment of the European External Action Service, while at the same time making savings at national level.
in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution and the call for an improvement to the legal situation that it contains.
Thus, this is one way ahead that will not strangle the Member States, instead opening up new alternatives for us all.
author. - Mr President, the illegal and unelected regime of Andry Rajoelina is riddled with corruption and has orchestrated serious human rights abuses in Madagascar, yet Rajoelina came to power pledging an end to corruption and human rights abuses that allegedly flourished under the ousted former President, Marc Ravalomanana.
It is too bad then that we are seeing our citizens moving in completely the opposite direction.
More than a year ago already, the European Parliament clearly expressed its support for the idea of a democratic process which could lead to elections.
As we restate in this resolution, he must not be able to stand in new elections - that must be made clear.
That is why I would opt for a measured tone in relation to the situation so that we leave an opportunity for negotiations, which should take place very urgently and, I hope, reach a conclusion.
We would have preferred it if the European Parliament had sent a clear message of support to the mediator of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), who has worked hard for a year to try to find the most amicable solution possible.
It is not possible to think that cohesion policy is succeeding, because it is not succeeding when Europe is regressing towards social divergence internally.
We would have preferred a message congratulating Mr Chissano on his mediation work, which led him to present a road map to the SADC for the resolution of the political crisis in Madagascar.
My final observation is that we will vote for the financial transaction tax but we believe it will only see the light of day if Europe has the courage to implement it independently of others.
Ford then said to me: you know, Niki, this was the first time I realised you have a Union that is so split, divided and unbalanced.
Thirdly: in addition, we welcome the fact that the Europe 2020 strategy is to be the reference point for the forthcoming MFF, which also entails consideration of the timeframe.
(PL) Mr President, anyone not in the know might come to the conclusion that the European Parliament is behaving irresponsibly by proposing a budgetary increase.
If the Member States decide to take certain measures, and we, as representatives of the citizens, are of the same opinion, we must have realistic funds.
However, as we all know, good results require not just hard-working Members, but also excellent staff.
In addition to the human suffering, Madagascar's biodiversity is under threat.
This illegal regime came into power in 2009 with military support and matters have not improved one bit.
This has been a sound and sensible process, as has already been said, and I would like to thank Mr Garriga Polledo and Mrs Haug for their excellent work.
In May 2011, representatives of the Africa Caribbean Pacific-European Union (ACP-EU) group took the view that Madagascar should have a viable temporary administration, and soon.
I therefore also think that it is necessary for us to have this possibility of a 5% rise, so that there is the opportunity for new policy areas and for meeting new demands, as well as for investing in transport, energy and research - areas that the EU must invest in in future.
I hope the sides which have been in conflict will now manage to introduce a road map which will provide for the establishment of an interim government until new and - I trust - fair elections are called.
I support the measures adopted by the European Union in a situation where the transition to a democratic system is being jeopardised indefinitely by the illegal and, by extension, unconstitutional way in which Rajoelina took power.
This must be demonstrated not only by appealing for free, pluralist elections to be organised and democratic order to be restored, but also, in practical terms, by providing proper humanitarian aid.
(IT) Mr President, it is only since July 2003 that Madagascar began again to take an active part in the life of the African Union, since until the end of the 1990s, its political and economic ties were predominantly with the non-aligned socialist countries.
In Jorge Semprún, we celebrate someone who was imprisoned in Buchenwald concentration and extermination camp, someone who fought Nazi forces in France and the Franco dictatorship in my country, Spain.
I mourn his death as both a colleague and a friend of his and I am going to ask President Buzek to send his family and the Spanish Government a message of heartfelt condolence and support, which I am sure that all of us here share.
Lord Dartmouth, to a large extent I agree with your view, but we also get indications from our interpreters that they cannot keep up with the pace.
(NL) Mr President, obviously, I will have to confine myself to a couple of essential comments.
At a time when many Member States are faced with difficult fiscal adjustments, the EU budget, 95% of which is used for investment, must provide a very high level of European added value.
We are opposing all attempts to bring about a transition to a one-sided, 'de facto' government.
We must also remember that although sanctions may prove successful, they should go hand in hand with a specific proposal for a solution to the political crisis, because the longer the current situation continues, the harder it will be in the future to bring the rule of law to Madagascar.
That is why we warn in this report that without sufficient resources, we will not be able to achieve the objectives we have set ourselves.
If we agree that the value of the European Union is much more than the sum of the 27 Member States that comprise it, if we are in favour of high quality, responsible agriculture, if we want to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, if we want to help our Mediterranean neighbours in their transition towards democracy, if we want to keep investing in research and innovation, if we want to carry on fighting climate change and investing in education, training and Erasmus grants, if we still believe in the cohesion policy as a tool for sustainable development and solidarity between our countries, and if we still support, for example, trans-European energy and transport networks - in short, if we still want more Europe - then we must call for a bigger budget for the European Union.
Now they say it is because of the crisis, but they wanted cuts when the current financial perspective was negotiated too.
We have put forward various options for doing this, but I have a preference for one of them, and Commissioner Lewandowski knows very well which one it is: it is the tax on financial transactions or, as it is known in many of our countries, the Robin Hood tax.
Not only would it be a disgrace to the US human rights record to put him on death row, but it could be totally counterproductive in the fight against terrorism.
We ask you to set your sights higher to ensure that the European project continues on track and does not become stalled, because that would cost us our future.
But Congress should also help him and press him to reverse this decision to reinstate the military commission system, as it offers no guarantee of a fair trial, and it must also reverse the decision to keep in indefinite detention detainees against whom no charges are brought.
Although the report is ambitious in seeking to find the greatest possible majority support from the House, I believe it lacks ambition in the objectives and aims it seeks to achieve in its current form.
The only response that occurs to the House and to the report is more money, although there is no clear indication where this money is to come from.
If people were serious about wanting structural reforms, they could have taken up the suggestion made by David Cameron, for example, of going to the Council and saying: funding is to be frozen, but we demand that unused resources should be able to be carried over to the next financial year, so that we can continue to spend them on viable projects and to save money.
But then, here in this Parliament we have a couple of 'Pavlovs': Mr Schulz, Mr Daul, Mr Verhofstadt, all absent now - they have run away instead of speaking here to focus the budget on quality rather than quantity, for example, by limiting regional and cohesion funds to the poorer Member States, saving 30% of those funds, and investing that money in innovation and future oriented policies.
Men have been held in detention for almost ten years on this part of Cuban territory for the sole purpose of bypassing US legal jurisdiction and in spite of the lack of evidence against some of them.
(FR) Mr President, as has already been said, it is clear that for a variety of reasons, some similar, some different, but in all cases exacerbated by the crisis, national budgets are struggling.
One is to all act alone, trying to reconcile spending and income, in some cases, according to what I have heard, worshiping austerity as an ends in its own right, making swingeing cuts to public spending and social benefits, thereby exacerbating the situation for citizens.
That is the purpose of the budgetary complementarity that we want to achieve through this convention-style conference, a proposal that we made to the Council during the conciliation procedure and that we have reiterated in this report.
Yes, it is essential to prevent the death sentence being imposed on Mr Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri and on many others, but we could have condemned more strongly the position of the United States in this regard, while regretting, at the very least, the change in attitude on the part of President Obama, particularly with regard to military tribunals.
Referring to these allegations against Romania, just like those Mrs Gomes made against Poland, does Mrs Vergiat believe that they help al-Nashiri's case?
I think that this convention-style model of dialogue between governments, the European Union, national parliaments and the European Parliament is the right way to rebuild confidence in Europe, both now and in the longer term.
Right now, when people everywhere are facing incredibly painful austerity measures, it is too insane for words that we in the European Union should be proposing to spend even more money.
For some countries, we overdo it, we make sweeping statements and, for others, rather arbitrarily, we only take into account specific situations.
According to the report, everything should remain as it is: more money has been requested for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, no reforms of the Structural Funds have been proposed, nowhere are there any concrete proposals for more efficiency.
While, in the Netherlands, nota bene, the Rutte cabinet is leaving the sick and the disabled out in the cold, the same groups in this House have a burning hole in their pockets.
Mr President, I would like to ask Ms Vergiat if it is true that her hatred is really directed towards the United States of America in its war against terror, rather than the issue of the death penalty?
At this point, it would be better to move towards a direct revenue system based exclusively on the gross domestic product of the Member States, or towards a shared and unified form of revenue such as value added tax, for example.
On the other hand, I would like to say that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has regarded and does regard a strong transatlantic relationship as a priority, in that this is based on the conviction of the existence of a set of common values and on respect for human rights.
However, I regret that a democracy like the United States and dictatorships which Mrs Vergiat is defending explicitly or implicitly are grouped together.
Mr President, the mocking of Her Majesty's Government by Mr Verhofstadt when he shared with us his logic as to why Britain should hand over more money and more power to the EU was further evidence of the palpable disdain in which the UK, its national government and its citizens are held by some in this House.
author. - Mr President, I would ask Mr Preda what he has to say to the fact that, in this Parliament this morning, many colleagues including myself heard Mr Thomas Hammarberg, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe, state clearly, in response to a question on this matter, that he indeed had corroboration of the serious suspicions of the existence of secret detention centres in Poland, in Lithuania and in Romania, and that he expected investigations to proceed.
I have only admiration for a US which defends the rule of law and human rights, and for a US that distinguishes itself from terrorists whose aim is indeed to detract from the rule of law and to violate democracy and human rights.
Matters were always conducted in an atmosphere of cooperation and there is no way of credibly confirming these actions.
Mrs Gomes, Romania is part of the European Union and should not be confused with the countries which we discuss in this Chamber every Thursday.
author. - (FR) I note that Mr Preda is straying far away from the situation we were discussing to come to the aid of Romania, but that was not my point.
What I would like to say is that I still feel it is wrong that we can put in the same boat, on an equal footing, democracies such as the United States or EU Member States, and countries and societies where power is exercised in an authoritarian and totalitarian manner, with ordinary citizens suffering excessive abuses.
If Mrs Vergiat felt offended by this, I am very sorry about that.
I think this issue is a good example of what it means to be consistent with our own principles and values, because this Parliament has spoken out on several occasions against the death penalty, wherever it may occur.
However, we must not forget that exiting the crisis also has European aspects: the economic development plan; financial market regulations to prevent this crisis from recurring; the measures currently being discussed on economic governance in the European Union; EU measures which only make national measures more efficient.
We Europeans must finally seriously come to terms with our shared responsibility for these grave violations of human rights.
Instead, we must deal with the facts, including the sources which Mrs Gomez referred to.
The subject is far too serious and it has rightly been said that our partnership with the USA is based on human rights.
Cutting the resources from existing programmes will not replace the need for additional new resources if we want to set new objectives for the European Union, if we want European integration to provide real added value, including for taxpayers, who rightly watch every penny allocated to the European budget.
(SV) Mr President, I have to say that in all my years in this Parliament, the work of the Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 is the most pleasant and the most visionary, in short, the most enjoyable - it really is very fine work.
Even terrorists have human rights, but they must, of course, have a legitimate punishment imposed on them in the interests of their victims.
However, I am personally extremely concerned about what we did not do, and that is set priorities.
We should have been much more rigorous in setting priorities, but what is most worrying of all in this context is the fact that we have left the setting of priorities to the Council.
Mr President, the public, the hardworking taxpayers across Europe who actually earn the money which so many in this place are so keen to spend, want Europe to do less and they want Europe to do it better.
(DE) Mr President, I am following in the tradition of Winston Churchill, who said: 'We must build a kind of United States of Europe'.
Unfortunately, this report proposes none of these things.
The declaration of the end of the war on terror was one of the first landmarks by President Obama.
To my dear fellow Members, may I recommend two documents that are worth reading before you turn your thoughts to rude criticism: the Treaty of Lisbon and the report itself.
I consider the message that the European budget needs a slight increase to be very important.
Slight in a sense that this 5% will also be modified by inflation, which means that we are not talking about an abnormal increase.
I do not think that anyone should be afraid to face the truth and certainly Parliament could, with a new report on this issue, bring some daylight to the issue and also do away with unjustified claims and suspicions.
I believe that we, who enjoy the support of a greater political force, likewise represent citizens' interests, and this is the reason why we say: do not hurt the agricultural policy and cohesion!
As was mentioned this morning, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe, whom I very much admire, Mr Thomas Hammarberg, explained to us that this is not a closed story, that it is still going on, and that he would very much wish for Parliament to cooperate with the Council of Europe on this important issue.
The WikiLeaks files have now given an even clearer picture of the grossest abuses of human rights that have taken place there - the widespread use of waterboarding, other forms of brutal torture to extract confessions and information - and they also revealed that hundreds of people were held in Guantánamo with no real evidence against them.
This hell-hole must be shut down immediately with all of the current detainees having access to fair trial before a civilian court, all of the secret CIA torture prisons in Europe must be shut down, the use of Shannon airport in Ireland for military and rendition flights by the CIA must be ended, and the barbaric death penalty must be brought to an end.
FP8 therefore needs adequate funding for the future.
Of course, this Parliament is strongly concerned about individual liberty and the due process of law, and rightly so, but we should recognise that some detainees do present a problem.
Although my outrage at, and condemnation of, all terrorist attacks and of fundamentalist terrorism remains absolute, I believe it is necessary to call for the abandonment of the death penalty in all cases and in all circumstances.
We are talking here of the Mr Fariñas to whom members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left did not wish the Sakharov prize to be awarded, saying that the designation had been exploited for political ends.
(FR) Mr President, here we have a prime example of the way in which the human rights issue is being used by the European Union for its own ends!
We, for our part, ask for universality of human rights.
Mr President, just as the right to life has a very special place among human rights, the death penalty has no place in democratic societies.
One conclusion is clear to me: only a united Europe that shows solidarity and strengthened, harmonised and convergent economic governance will be up to the task of successfully confronting the political challenges we have before us.
Mr President, I agree with my colleagues who are saying that, when we make such a serious accusation against a country, we have to be sure that we have all the necessary information.
However, this strategy will only be successful if there is a budget corresponding to its activities; to its objectives.
I therefore believe it essential that funding for cohesion policy at least remain at the same levels, along with funding for the common agricultural policy (CAP).
He is not only emblematic because of Guantánamo and the death penalty, but also because he is one of the only two named victims of secret detentions in Europe.
(PT) Mr President, we have here yet another sorry example of the double standards that are so often evident in this House.
The last few months have also highlighted the fact that protection of our common values, non-discrimination and human rights also need protection and resources, that we need to simplify the use of resources for the management of extraordinary situations, and that we need our own resources to create a better, stronger and more extensive Europe in the coming period.
Such words are never in short supply when it comes to condemning certain other countries!
Mr President, allow me to conclude by saying that, rather than to appeal for the Guantánamo base to be closed, it would be more to the point to call for the restoration of Cuba's sovereignty over this part of her territory, which is illegally occupied by the United States.
Those who are arguing for more money at a European level would have a stronger case if we knew that we had an absolute cast-iron understanding of where the money actually goes.
We must, however, make it much clearer that the war against terrorism cannot be waged at the expense of human rights and other basic values.
Last but not least, in reply to Mr Verhofstadt, it is unwise to single out any one Member State when there are a number of Member States which are net contributors to the budget.
Two important principles must be borne in mind: an unconditional 'no' to the death penalty, and the fact that the war against terrorism must also be a war against the causes of terrorism.
As you know, our transatlantic relations are based on values that we have shared for a long time, such as universal human rights and the right to a fair trial.
However, Parliament is also passing up an opportunity with the Garriga Polledo report.
Lawyers acting for two Guantánamo prisoners are involved in the investigation, so if any evidence does exist, it should be placed in the hands of the Polish prosecution service so that it can be examined.
One of the members of that committee says about this in Poland today that there is evidence, in the form of a document signed by a former socialist prime minister of Poland, and which regulated the question of a detention centre.
(FI) Mr President, it has to be said that this debate and the political squabbling that goes on between us have not entirely served the purpose of this resolution in the best possible way or shown that in this House, and unanimously across the EU generally, we are keen to defend each person's right to an impartial trial and, moreover, that we are opposed to the death penalty.
Consequently, it is by means of this resolution that we want to say that we indeed do not accept what he has done.
There can be no future for a system like this in European regional policy.
Nevertheless, we attach a great deal of importance to protecting human rights as part of the process of combating terrorism.
Despite the decree issued by the President in March of this year in which he officially authorised a longer stay in Guantánamo for some prisoners, the Union hopes - no, in fact, expects - the government of the United States to continue to discuss this subject in Congress and to work towards closing the detention camp as quickly as possible.
I think that you are dreaming when you simply claim that we have come up with compromises and that these are unambiguous.
I can assure you that the European Union is monitoring the proceedings carefully and will regularly raise its concerns with regard to the death penalty and the fairness of the trial with the US authorities in an appropriate manner.
The death penalty does not have a place in a country that defends human dignity, which is at the core of human rights.
However, the crux of the matter - and probably the stumbling block - will be agreeing a figure that tallies with the policies described in the report.
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I want to state that the development of democracy in Ukraine is a priority for us on which we cannot compromise.
If we basically expect the Ukrainian Government not to interfere in the work of the independent court and prosecutor's office, what right does the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have to call today for the European Parliament itself to get involved in such political interference?
So I would ask the Commissioner to show leadership, to be courageous, and to remember that research and science, infrastructure ...
(DE) Mr President, I would simply like to ask my fellow Member what the continuous declarations concerning the universality of human rights mean when, in the case of Ukraine, the issue suddenly only concerns internal affairs.
In cases which concern human rights, we will always intervene, in particular with regard to a partner as important as Ukraine.
Experience shows that cohesion is now a vital nexus of the European project, and an important asset for everyone to safeguard, protect and renew.
However, I maintain that the challenge of intermediate categories and the safeguard clause is one that we must take on in order to begin a new phase in Europe's cohesion policy and also to realise, within the cohesion policy, the more balanced and sustainable development that we want to assure for Europe over the coming years.
If we are talking about universality - I do not know how many minutes I have, Mr President - but if we look around, there are European Union Member States where we can see very similar cases.
I will believe you, Mr Posselt, that you adhere to the principles and want us to enforce human rights everywhere - both in the European Union and Ukraine - if you table such a resolution for Bulgaria as well where prime ministers and former ministers are being investigated on absurd charges.
Until then, I had no idea that the ministers and prime ministers of some countries enjoyed special lifetime immunity.
Incidentally, Mr Danilishin has never been a member of any political party, so the charge brought against him is entirely economic in nature.
Let us stop carping about the 2.5% of public spending with which we are supposed to maintain the whole apparatus required to implement the 2020 strategy and to fulfil all the responsibilities accorded to us under the Treaty of Lisbon.
Anyone who turns the constitutional right of an accused person to access their files into the exact opposite, in other words, into a compulsion to access the files, and anyone who does this, as in the case of Mr Lutsenko, by means of imprisonment and, in the case of Mrs Tymoshenko, by a total of 44 summonses so far, clearly demonstrates what sort of person he is and the fact that he is abusing the judicial system in the old-fashioned way for the purposes of political disputes.
That is why this House should adopt the report.
European solidarity includes the need to finance the 2020 strategy, not least its social objectives, which include combating poverty.
I would like to ask Mr Gahler if he is willing to declare that he is in favour of giving such a political perspective to Ukrainian society and to politicians of all persuasions and that the road to the European Union is open to them, and if he will endorse statements of this kind in the European Parliament.
If Europe really intends to implement the policies enshrined in the Treaties, including the new policies found in the Treaty of Lisbon, it needs the financial wherewithal to realise those aims.
While I share the opinion about the necessity of bringing Ukraine closer to the Union, I also think that this must involve the adoption by Ukraine of European standards in the field of the rule of law and transparency in public life.
It is with great concern that I have followed the corruption scandals in Ukraine and the trials of politicians who are being accused in a way which is sometimes ludicrous.
I think Ukraine's European aspirations, which, on the one hand, are hedged around with conditions, should, on the other, show a willingness to help in this.
It leads to the logic expressed in the context of the 2011 budget negotiations that if we cut our national budgets due to the crisis, we should apply the same approach to the EU budget.
As we all know, nobody is perfect in this world, but it is in accordance with Europe's political standards and norms, and also in accordance with the logic and values of democracy, that we expect the Ukrainian authorities not to abuse their power by encouraging and holding politically motivated trials, and instead to give those who are suspects a fair trial, rather than political retribution.
There is always a risk that the same coalition that adopts the budgetary decision in the Council can also adopt the same decision in the European Parliament.
We therefore need to significantly increase financing of science and innovation, so as to promote scientific excellence throughout Europe.
Therefore, if we really want to help Ukraine to develop an open, democratic society, we should concentrate on systemic recommendations and not tell them that those senior officials who may be endearing to some of you or with whom you may be friends should be treated any differently from other criminal suspects.
Indeed, here in the European Union, we also say that all are equal, and that includes equality before the law.
After all, the question of what we do, which has been discussed in detail here, is at least as important as the question of how we do it.
We see this as yet another abuse of public power to discredit political opponents, which is absolutely unacceptable in a democratic society.
(PL) Mr President, we are wondering what the essence is of what we are talking about because the facts are, after all, generally known, and we are coming down in favour of those who today are having problems, and of those who are finding themselves at the wrong end of the abuse of authority.
However, in this Chamber, we must also say something very clearly to ourselves.
So, as well as holding this debate, we also have something else to do - to say clearly: the door is open, do not worry.
(RO) Mr President, the rapporteur started his presentation with a very important sentence, saying that we need to combine traditional European Union policies with our new priorities.
We all understand that we will have to fundamentally change the direction of current policy and this is reflected clearly in the Europe 2020 strategy.
Is this really all that can be sent from this Chamber and from the EU institutions to the Ukrainians, who are fighting today about the same things which once happened to the Poles and the Czechs?
It seems to me that it is precisely that which we need to know, because then we will be able to justify what we are voting for.
(FI) Mr President, the charges that have been brought against Tymoshenko are, as she herself has said, purely political in nature.
We also have to remind ourselves that several other former members of her Cabinet are also accused or suspected of corruption.
Instead, we want to remind everyone of how important it is that these hearings cannot be selective in any sense and that the legal proceedings must be open and must be non-discriminatory.
May I say that I wish to thank Lady Ashton for expressing her concern back in May regarding the charges brought against the Ukrainian opposition leaders, and their possible political ends.
However, Ukraine must adopt European standards also in the administration of judicial power, which is characterised by politicised trials in which the accused do not enjoy all the rights and means necessary to face a trial that, in some cases, is a purely political trial.
However we must be careful about where we do so: one proposal would be to reduce military spending; another would be to reduce the two European Parliament sites to a single one.
Thirdly, what most concerned me was seeing Mr Lewandowski smiling, in what I believe to be a worrying way, when the subject of the tax on financial transactions was mentioned.
The Ukrainian Government must respect the opposition, without brandishing the weapon of judicial power, and respect the rules of a democratic state and human rights, as subscribed to in the Eastern Partnership agreements.
It worried me, and I would ask him how it could be so bad, so detrimental, to ask those who have become rich by speculating to pay for the crisis instead of asking those who are least to blame for it to do so, and not do as you did yesterday, calling for Spain to reduce social spending through a reduction in expenditure on ...
However, if it is approved as it stands now, it will be difficult for you to keep your promise.
Mr President, I thought the EU could not get any worse and then I came across this report.
It is not Ukraine's justice system which is the biggest concern, but the possible interference of politics in the administration of justice.
(RO) Mr President, the motion for a resolution relating to the case of the members of the former Ukrainian Government is needed to ensure respect for the basic principles of the European Union, starting with respect for human rights.
Since the beginning of the year, we have been making clear our concerns about the possible political motivation that lies behind these cases.
We do not want to take sides in any individual cases, but we expect Ukraine to bring about fundamental changes in its system in order to guarantee impartial, fair and transparent court proceedings.
The speed and the scope of our integration with Ukraine, and vice versa, will depend on whether Ukraine can fully guarantee its respect for human rights, the principles of democracy and the principles of the rule of law.
Ukraine is not alone in this respect, but it must demonstrate its unconditional determination to introduce more comprehensive and more inclusive reforms if it wants to move closer to the EU.
, in writing. - I was surprised by the wish of some political forces in the European Parliament to support former leaders of Ukraine both morally and politically.
They want new priorities and a reduced budget; I say to them that going down this route will mean that they end up with a reduced budget and fewer priorities.
I certainly do not understand how they can sit in this hemicycle and defend an intergovernmental approach.
I want to acknowledge the constructiveness of the proposals and the debate, which I feel has been sufficiently vibrant and has fully expressed the mosaic of viewpoints which unite the European Parliament.
At the same time, the Helsinki Committee is warning that Ukraine is breaching the European Convention on Human Rights.
The real problem, however, lies in the continued lack of democratic reform in Ukraine.
I think, too, that achieving democracy is not easy, but requires the will to introduce change and take forceful steps.
Europe should lead the world by levying this tax within its borders and campaigning for it to be introduced in the rest of the world.
The delegation is here in the European Parliament this week to take part in a four-day study visit organised by the Office for the Promotion of Parliamentary Democracy.
Instead, we must ask ourselves questions regarding the principles governing the EU's functioning in the next seven-year period: is it to be an EU based on solidarity, which fulfils its obligations and establishes an innovative economy and a common foreign policy in line with the Treaty of Lisbon?
I am a staunch advocate of the former, and I support the rapporteur's opinion as regards the need to increase funding in the next Multiannual Financial Framework by 5% compared to 2013 levels.
It is clear from the report of Salvador Garriga Polledo that adequate funding will have to be secured for EU policies if the Union still wants to focus on achieving the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.
Jean Monnet warned in his time: 'Europe has never existed. One must genuinely create Europe'.
The founding father of European integration did not regard this task as a single act, but as continuous work.
Accordingly, we must assess expected conditions and specific circumstances and determine what we have to do to make sure that Europe exists and does not end up as a loser.
There is no reason to draft European legislation unless there is a real need for it.
Nevertheless, the financial sceptics should be aware of the extent of the benefits the common market confers upon the individual Member States' economies.
The EU can succeed when all its Members are treated by the same standards.
Fears were also voiced regarding corruption, since opportunity - or a great deal of money - makes the thief.
I also support the view that unused funds should remain in the budget earmarked for cohesion, and not returned to the Member States, and I believe that we need a thorough analysis of the possible consequences of including the European Development Fund in the EU budget, in particular, in light of the EU's obligations to third countries.
In such a situation, we should not be surprised that they fail to understand why the European Parliament is asking for more resources.
Instead, we should consistently pursue every opportunity to make savings.
The adoption of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo marks an import step for this House: it constitutes a clear, pragmatic and realistic statement of the European Parliament's budgetary ambitions post-2013.
It is not, as the Eurosceptics claim, an example of European profligacy, but rather a courageous admission that if we do not give ourselves the means to build Europe together, we will remain isolated and powerless.
Consequently, so as to be able to finance the actions linked to the EU's new competences under the Treaty of Lisbon, I am supporting the request for the question of own resources to be examined and for new forms of Community income, in order to ease the pressure on national budgets and to do away with the belief in a 'fair return' which is economically inaccurate and politically unsound.
It is now the European Commission's turn to take into account in its legislative proposal the European Parliament's opinion.
Now we have to declare loud and clear that these objectives can only be achieved if we assign sufficient resources to them.
In a period when many Member States are suffering from the 'Mediterranean dilemma', whereby the country needs fiscal expansion in order to stimulate growth, but it cannot be done because never-ending austerity measures would be inevitable due to the country's indebtedness, we cannot respond by decreasing or approving the current EU budget that is fundamentally aimed at development.
The creation of 'intermediate regions' as proposed in the report means that relatively rich areas of poorer Member States will still receive support, and will be able to prepare gradually for the point in time when they lose this additional funding entirely.
Parliament's adoption of this proposal today would send out a very important message in the debate on the future shape of cohesion policy.
Let me express hope that you will agree with the judgment of President Buzek, who recently said 'after the Hungarian Presidency Europe will be stronger and better'.
Let me focus on some specific points: I have written a letter to the members of the European Council outlining the positions of the Commission on what I believe are the most important items on the agenda, and I would like to share our positions with you.
I would like to thank this Parliament very sincerely for the extremely hard work and commitment it has shown in maintaining a high level of ambition on this issue.
There is no point in signing off on a brand new economic governance package if, the very same week, Member States question the methodology and independent Commission recommendations in the country-specific exercise.
I spoke to Parliament in May about the Commission's migration package, which sets recent and future policy initiatives in a framework that allows the EU and its Member States to manage asylum, migration and mobility of third-country nationals in a secure environment.
We are also exploring the feasibility of a safeguard system which would allow the adoption of decisions at European level to confront possible difficult situations where our common external borders are subject to exceptional pressure or where Member States are failing to comply with their obligations to control their borders.
Essentially, I think that by adopting this measure, Europe has demonstrated that it is further ahead than many Member States, which will clearly have to remedy this situation in short order.
I therefore hope that Parliament's decision will be productive and function as a stimulus so that the attitudes and the level of attention for this issue will be substantially improved in the not too distant future.
However, it is not always right to attack a single category; we also need to defend the principle that it cannot be solely road hauliers to pay, but also those in Europe who do not put enough energy into supporting an alternative transport system.
One thing I agreed to here, for the sake of compromise, was that the money that is being charged here for heavy goods traffic can be spent on rail transport or shipping.
(PL) Mr President, I wish to make it quite clear that the recommendations Parliament has adopted today will not be so straightforward under the conditions existing in Poland.
On the one hand, I would have liked to have seen a clear formulation to the effect that the financial resources collected there really are to be used for road building.
I would have liked to support this particular measure but I had to vote against because, as has been said already by my colleague, Pat the Cope Gallagher, Ireland's economy is heavily dependent on exports.
Despite the criticisms of industry organisations, I think that the Council's position is the best compromise available right now, even though I hope that improvements can be made in the future.
Secondly, the situation that they - and indeed many other countries in Europe - are experiencing is the result of many years of living beyond their means.
My third message is a product of the first two: Europe can only help Greece, or any other country in difficulty, if it does everything it possibly can to consolidate its economic and financial situation in the long term.
This too must be said, and I cannot help but think of the example of Latvia here: a few years ago, it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and thanks to a courageous recovery policy led by the country's twice-elected Prime Minister, Valdis Dombrovskis, it has restored a balanced situation.
We will emerge from the crisis not by pinpointing scapegoats (Europe, the International Monetary Fund and others), but by rolling up our sleeves - and when I say 'us', I am of course talking about the political class, but also about all of the 500 million European citizens.
However, I have chosen to speak again because a number of contributors to the debate have said that we should only deal with these accounts and ignore GDP completely.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Leinen report because I am convinced that by recording this data in the various countries, we will learn far more about the situation in these countries.
We simply want an assurance that they will be complied with.
However, the values that Europe embodies - solidarity, tolerance, openness towards others, respect for minorities, respect for human rights and human dignity - have never been more deserving of support than in these times of globalisation, when the balance of power too often takes precedence over everything else.
I am certain that if the people of Europe so wish, and if the Union overcomes division and populism, we will emerge stronger from the difficult times we are currently experiencing.
(DA) Mr President, we have today voted on and adopted in Parliament a decision recognising that Romania and Bulgaria are ready for admission into the Schengen cooperation.
However, I think that there are a number of reasons why we should take seriously the concern felt by European citizens on account of the rising level of corruption in many Member States and the increasing level of cross-border crime.
I will say one thing, which is perhaps one of the most unpopular messages that could be given in Europe right now.
I will say it nevertheless, because I am firmly convinced that it is right.
That means that there are 43 heads of companies that are at least as powerful as the Polish Prime Minister.
However, in this case, I believe it is our business; we know that Bulgaria and Romania have serious problems with crime and corruption and I do not believe that their border controls are as good as those which would obtain in other Schengen countries.
It could, in fact, be made very much better and much more could be done immediately.
The emerging powers and the emerging economies of this world are not waiting for Europe to split into its constituent parts, from large parts like Germany down to very small parts like Malta, in the belief that each individual part will be able to survive on its own - the renationalisation rhetoric that many politicians are giving their people.
If we have the shared will to make the strongest economy in the world - because that is what Europe is if it holds together - into a success by standing together in solidarity.
The Seventh Framework Programme is the main instrument for funding research in Europe, as shown by the report voted on today.
I call upon the Commission to acknowledge Parliament's observations and to identify solutions to make it easier for SMEs to access the seventh and eighth research programmes.
Funding is extremely important, and it could be a little more ambitious, since it is being stated here that this level is credible and necessary.
It is not on the table today either in the Council or in Parliament.
I therefore feel that it is necessary to review the financing schemes and to strive to ensure during FP8 that there are no more disparities or discrimination, so that we can successfully address the challenges mentioned in the Europe 2020 strategy.
I believe that the simplification process is the most important thing we can underline in a mid-term review.
Yesterday, Mr Lipsky, the current Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said that Europe should create one political and economic union to face this crisis.
It is not only us - the federalists in the European Parliament - who are saying that.
Sector-specific analyses are simply a way of looking for a reason to say no, because the truth is there will always be both winners and losers.
It is true that a country in such a situation yearns for political unity, and it is not by playing petty political games, as is currently the case in Greece, that this situation will be resolved.
I want to ask President Barroso something directly: yesterday, the spokesman for the European Commission said at the press conference that there was no need for more reverse QMV in the governance package.
(FR) Mr President, I would like to say the following to the Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe: I am sure that when he, with his liberal governments, manages to establish full solidarity for all the various countries, I and my group will have already beaten him to it where Greece is concerned, and I will remind him of that here in this Chamber.
I also believe that it is a fine idea to introduce the principle of civil liability in situations of obvious negligence.
(CS) Mr President, I listened attentively to Mr Verhofstadt, the Chair of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and I would like to ask him whether I am correct in thinking that his motto might be that Greece is everywhere, since Greece is not just a Member State of the European Union, but is actually a state of mind, and that Greece is therefore everywhere.
We were rightly made to prove ourselves, to prove that we met the Copenhagen criteria, to prove that we enjoyed fully-functioning market economies and so on and so forth, but unfortunately this level of scrutiny was not applied to some European countries when entering the euro zone.
In future, it will therefore be necessary for Parliament and international and European trade unions to work together and add their positive and urgent recommendations to the initiative voted on here today.
We always have to act in accordance with European values and international social and labour standards, even in third countries.
This European Council should send a clear signal that if a country's position is unsustainable within the euro zone then, unless it makes dramatic changes, the euro zone should not hesitate to raise the possibility of restructuring its debt or even - however cruel it might seem - of its leaving the club.
Mr Barroso, if you do not do that, then I will tell you what will happen next: your opponents - or rather the opponents of your successor - will not be nice, decent Eurosceptics like me, but really nasty anti-Europeans.
In the same way, I would ask you to please stop using or misusing every crisis as an opportunity to pursue further the supra-nationalistic agenda towards something like fiscal union or tax union, because it leads us nowhere.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mrs Győri, ladies and gentlemen, I am amazed at how raucous the debate on the deepest crisis that the European Union has experienced for a long time has suddenly become.
When we realise that we are currently defending Schengen, that we have been unable to defend the freedom of the press in Hungary during this Council Presidency, that we needed a long time even to begin to find a common European language with regard to Libya and Egypt, then it is no wonder that, in the face of the worsening situation in Greece, all we can say is that, although we now have many leaders in Europe, we have no leadership.
The idea that the European Union can only continue in the way that we want it to and also provide a better life for all Europeans if we rescue Greece and stabilise the South is one that has not been communicated at all up to now, and I believe there is actually an institution responsible for this and that is the European Council.
We therefore need to clarify the fact that development cooperation is the one policy area of external action, besides humanitarian aid, which has not been designed to serve EU interests, but to defend the interests of the most marginalised and vulnerable populations on this planet.
(PL) Mr President, despite the fact that the European Parliament has repeatedly acknowledged the advantages that would be conferred upon the Internal Market by improvements to the framework of contract law, the introduction of a new system of contract law using an optional instrument has encountered a series of major problems, in terms of both substance and procedure.
I believe that it is an expression of the incompetence of the political leadership in the European Union that what we have recognised to be right, namely that private creditors must also share the burden, is not implemented because we are afraid of the credit rating agencies.
Therefore, the issue that brought us into this crisis is still the dominating factor and so far there has been no political leadership to tackle this.
Austerity demands as well as the call to sell off the last of the state-owned silver will not rescue Greece. However, everything is just continuing as before.
That is why we have to focus our energy on providing wide-ranging, high-quality education and, furthermore, pay attention to the perspective of gender, so that the underlying causes of youth unemployment can be eliminated.
We should also remember the role of further training because it is that which promotes lifelong learning and prepares people for changes in the labour market.
The other important point, on which I voted differently from my group, was Amendment 37d, which originally points to the significant savings that could be made if the European Parliament were to have a single seat.
It does not make any difference, no matter how we vote: we know that savings will be made.
This really concerns us, not because we do not believe that the focus of the cohesion policy should be extended, but because we think that without additional resources, this extension risks depriving and reducing the resources for the areas referred to in Objective 1 - the so-called convergence objective - which need just as much attention and support from the European Union.
To sum up, I am pleased with the report and I am pleased with the work that has been done, but I have some concerns about the attention that we seem to have paid to a policy that could have confirmed the so-called 'facing-out', as we are used to seeing.
Firstly, I welcome the commitment in the report to at least maintaining the CAP and cohesion funding at present levels in the next perspective.
It does not affect my colleagues in Ireland or ourselves at all because even though we are in the IMF - and we are broke as a country - we are well above the European average in GDP terms; so whether there is an intermediate category or not does not affect us.
However, we do think that there is a need for a fundamental appraisal of cohesion policy going forward because, as more and more regions go above the 75% threshold, the policy is either going to become redundant or be reformed, and that is what we expect to happen.
The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU.
I agree with the rapporteur's position that, although there are some outstanding issues that will require regular reporting and a follow-up at some point in the future, they do not constitute an obstacle to full Schengen membership for these two Member States.
Now, however, all Member States need to agree on their effective participation in the area without internal borders.
Currently, free movement is guaranteed on a territory with 42 673 km of external sea and 7 721 km of land borders, covering 25 countries and 400 million citizens.
This is an important step forward for these countries, as well as a strengthening of European citizenship.
I sincerely hope that this report will be voted for at the next session of the European Council because the faster we move on this issue, the more we will all gain - politically, economically and socially.
The draft resolution therefore flies directly in the face of the citizen's need for protection - which Lega Nord has always put at the core of its programme - and I cannot support it.
in writing. - I voted against the Schengen acquis being extended to encompass Bulgaria and Romania simply because I do not think provisions have been made to make sure they adjoin the passport-free area safely and effectively.
These issues are undoubtedly important, but the proposal is purely politically motivated.
The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU.
There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system.
Today's vote in the European Parliament has highlighted that Romania is ready to apply the Schengen acquis.
This is why I find it regrettable that there are still doubts about our readiness to apply the acquis and that some Member States continue to protect their so-called 'national security' by putting unjustified obstacles in the way of a Member State which has earned its right to be treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.
Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work he has done in drawing up this report, despite the obstacles the Council placed in the way of accessing certain documentation considered essential to achieving this.
Verification that new Member States meet the conditions necessary for the full application of the Schengen acquis is a precondition for the adoption of the Council decision to abolish border checks at internal borders, after it has consulted the European Parliament.
Verification that new Member States meet the conditions necessary for the application of every part of the Schengen acquis is a precondition for the EU Council of Ministers adopting a decision to abolish border checks at internal borders with these countries, after it has consulted the European Parliament.
Given our position on the accession of these countries, we have maintained our position of abstention, reinforced by the pressure that continues to be exerted on these countries.
It also provides wonderful opportunities for illegal immigrants, who know that no matter where they enter Europe, they will be able to settle wherever they like: France is particularly hard hit.
These issues are undoubtedly important, but the proposal is purely politically motivated.
This vision of a two-speed Europe, with different rules for old and new Member States, is quite simply unacceptable.
The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU.
There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system.
I did not endorse this document because taking into account the results of the evaluations and the necessary revisits carried out by teams of experts, the committee responsible has concluded that there are some outstanding issues that will require regular reporting and a follow-up at some point in the future.
The assessments carried out show that both Romania and Bulgaria have proved that they are sufficiently prepared to apply all the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner.
This means that additional measures need to be adopted because, as we know, the abolition of internal border controls requires a high level of mutual trust between Member States and also the existence of effective controls on external borders, since the security of the Schengen area depends on the rigour and efficiency with which each Member State carries out its external border checks.
Like all Romanian and European citizens, I want the reforms to the justice system in my country to continue, the level of corruption and fraud to be reduced, cases to be judged justly and more quickly, and the guilty to be punished harshly.
I thank the Union and Member States which are helping us carry out permanent reforms to the justice system and implement anti-corruption measures because this is also what Romanian citizens want.
in writing. - I voted for this report on the basis of expert reports which say that at this moment, both Romania and Bulgaria have proved that they are sufficiently prepared to apply all the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner.
I am abstaining so as not to vote against freedom of movement within the Union.
This is a precondition for the EU Council of Ministers in deciding to abolish checks at internal borders with those Member States, following consultation with the European Parliament.
What a change in comparison to the era when Europe was scattered with border posts where checks - nit-picking ones at times - were the norm, not to mention the impossibility for citizens in the East to cross the iron curtain without risking their lives!
In order for the Schengen area to be able to function effectively and for the goals set to be achieved, it is necessary to ensure that the abolition of border control does not have negative consequences, particularly as regards illegal migration.
My group considers the introduction of new criteria for membership at this point to be wrong because this would mean applying double standards for these countries.
I also believe that even though both countries have worked hard for the free movement of their citizens within Europe, they should, in any case, continue to bring their controls and rules into line with European standards, given the sensitive nature of the eastern European borders in the Balkans.
This means that the removal of internal border controls requires a high level of mutual trust between Members States regarding the existence of effective external border controls because the security of the Schengen area depends on how rigorously and effectively each Member State controls its external borders.
This phenomenon is of great significance and has repercussions on the daily lives of many of our citizens, exacerbating the insecurity they face.
The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU.
There is no denying that the technical securing of borders will not automatically make them impermeable as long as problems persist in combating corruption in the justice and policing system.
The issue concerning Bulgaria giving its military police access to information from Schengen records demonstrates that there are problems with those parts of Schengen that these countries are already included in.
However, some issues remain outstanding, in particular, the need to establish a plan to combat possible pressure from illegal migration.
The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU.
The Union must apply the same criteria to all Member States, including when it comes to joining the Schengen area.
Nevertheless, the 27 governments in Council concluded, perhaps surprisingly, that Bulgaria fulfilled the conditions for Schengen, a system which is itself under question at the moment.
I welcome the majority of over 80% received in the European Parliament during the vote in favour of adopting the report on the fulfilment of the Schengen acquis by Romania and Bulgaria.
Despite having a few doubts about the excessive reach of the text - which falls within the ambit of the Europe 2020 strategy - I think the objectives of the resolution are most welcome.
I therefore voted in favour of Mr Coelho's report on verifying the necessary conditions for the application of the Schengen acquis, which is a prerequisite for the abolition of internal border controls with Bulgaria and Romania.
We all know well that Member States that belong to the UN Security Council (France, the United Kingdom and Germany) failed to act in concert and come up with a single position vis-à-vis military intervention in Libya, in particular, with regard to the vote on the UN Security Council Resolution 1973.
I think the European Union should see this as a starting point and take a truly active role in dealing with both current and emerging world powers, shaking off once and for all its reputation as a political dwarf in terms of international policy.
Today's vote comes after a relevant success for the EU in the UN: the adoption of a set of modalities granting the EU delegation in the UN General Assembly the right to make interventions, as well as the right of reply and the ability to present oral proposals and amendments.
This coordination is also very important in the United Nations (UN).
The creation of a United Nations parliamentary assembly within the framework of the United Nations system is an interesting proposal that is worth studying and debating.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur's proposals mentioned above, as well as with the need to foster a debate on the role of parliaments and national assemblies in the UN system, and on creating a UN parliamentary assembly.
The report advocates giving the European Union a seat on the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and a permanent seat on the Security Council.
How can an EU which, in alliance with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the United States, is promoting a war, and violating international law and the UN Charter in Libya, contribute to making the UN more democratic, or to humanity's peace and progress?
How can the EU contribute to non-intervention in states' internal affairs, and respect their sovereignty and independence, and their right to development - rights enshrined in the UN Charter and in international law - when, in partnership with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it is imposing an unprecedented programme of aggression against the workers and people of Portugal, and of the usurping of their resources?
The current change in the international order is pushing the European Union to make a more active effort in its dealings with world and emerging powers so that it can take a proactive role in building a United Nations that can make an effective contribution to global solutions: peace, security, democracy and an international order based on the rule of law.
This represents an essential starting point for dealing with climate change and environmental degradation, the universality and indivisibility of human rights, poverty reduction and development for all, the consequences of demographic change, migration and international organised crime.
I believe that these are the issues that are critical on the global stage right now, and the EU has to involve itself and play a vital role in all these aspects.
The Vice-President/High Representative (VP/HR) should be authorised to draft guidelines for regular consultations between the ambassadors of the Member States and the EU ambassadors, especially between those working at a multilateral level in places like Geneva and New York, so that the EU can successfully pursue its UN agenda and meet the expectations of UN members regarding its ability to act.
I am voting for this report, firstly because it criticises the Commission for delaying publication until 9 February 2011, even though it was obliged to table it in 2010, and because, like the rapporteur, I regret the weakness of the Commission communication as regards new developments.
I do, however, acknowledge that the joint technology initiatives help make European industry more competitive, although the already existing legal and administrative obstacles need to be dealt with quickly.
It is also very important for research and development policies to be territorialised so that research is distributed harmoniously in relation to all universities.
In this report, the European Parliament is carrying out a mid-term review in order to ensure that FP7 meets the needs of European policies.
I agree that in order to ensure that this programme is as effective as possible, it is necessary to simplify complicated and burdensome administrative procedures so as to successfully create a European Research Area.
Therefore, this report serves to highlight the relevance of an unknown programme while calling for changes: to alter the overly burdensome administrative and financial regulations and the low rate of success that make this programme still too prohibitive for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), at a time when they play an important role in turning research outcomes into products and services; to ensure better cooperation and coordination between the various stakeholders at a time when the funding of research still remains split between national and European sources.
I voted in favour of this report because I believe that an appropriate mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities is particularly important for establishing whether the programme's implementation accords with the objectives set.
In addition to the generally positive assessment, the report draws the Commission's attention to many aspects of the programme's implementation and provides specific proposals as to how they might be improved.
For example, the report proposes increasing the programme's financing but, at the same time, it proposes identifying common research areas among those which appear most promising in terms of concrete applications, enabling the highest extent of sharing in an ethical context, so that tangible results are achieved when implementing this programme.
Despite the fact that Europe is still behind the US and is losing the lead it had over the developing economies, the results of the Seventh Framework Programme demonstrate the added value of this European programme for research and development in Europe.
Unfortunately, however, there is still no method for evaluating how far the projects funded by the Seventh Framework Programme have advanced scientific knowledge.
It is also necessary to point out the legal and administrative obstacles (legal subjectivity, funding rules and sometimes also intellectual property) which may dissuade many key research players and SMEs from participating.
In my view, simplifying administrative procedures and cutting red tape is still the most important challenge if we really want to let our businesses - and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises - have access to funds.
This report helps to draw attention to the factors which are crucial in meeting the requirements of the future of research in Europe, in particular, in the context of the objectives assigned by the Europe 2020 strategy.
We must ensure a better distribution of research infrastructure throughout the European Union, while respecting the principle of excellence which allows Europe to attract the best researchers in the world.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur, specifically as regards the recommendations regarding the need to simplify mechanisms for accessing funds, making procedures simpler and more transparent, and facilitating the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Particularly important is its concern to ensure that 40% of those taking part in research are women, as this figure is currently no higher than 25.5%, and to recognise that 'Europe continues to lag behind the US and is losing the lead it had over the emerging economies'.
However, we are concerned about some aspects, not least the principles guiding the European Research Area, since it should be focused on cooperation between genuine research and collaboration networks, reversing any trends towards concentration of scientific and human resources in the more developed countries and mitigating the currently existing inequalities in national research systems.
Among other things, the programme welcomes the level of participation and excellent results in the selection of projects, but it is a pity that the success rate in the programme generally remains relatively low.
I voted in favour of this resolution because it calls for the use of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) to take account of the different consequences in each Member State of the economic crisis for the final years of the programme (2011-2013), given the considerable sums (EUR 28.8 billion over three years) still to be programmed, the objectives to be achieved for EU 2020 and preparation for a European Research Area and the Innovation Union.
Europe's rapidly ageing society requires innovative solutions in diverse areas which will make it possible for it to function efficiently in spite of the reduced workforce.
The way to find solutions to such unusual situations is investment in science and technological development.
The assertion that web sites and individual computer systems are constantly monitored by INDECT is false, as confirmed by the ethical review carried out on the INDECT project in Brussels on 15 March 2011, with the participation of specialists from Austria, France, Holland, Germany and the United Kingdom.
The actions taken so far to develop knowledge in the most varied of fields demonstrate the ever more acute need to move towards spreading innovations and implementing them in our daily lives.
It was precisely the direct impact of this instrument on everyday life that led me to vote in favour of the report by Mr Audy, in the hope that future innovation policies will make the absolute most of the synergies in the whole research and development value chain.
Indeed, Europe lags behind the United States and is being caught up very quickly by the emerging countries; it must therefore quickly re-establish innovation at the forefront of its social model.
However, the report also calls for stricter regulations for the EU's INDECT programme.
It states that the EU Commission should immediately publish all project documents and define a clear and strict mandate for the research goal, the application and end users of INDECT.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Audy because the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) needs to be thoroughly revised in order for it to achieve and come into line with the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy.
It is now important, and I share the rapporteur's ambition in this respect, to analyse the work done and reorganise future work.
The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) needs to be reviewed in order to bring it further into line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.
I voted in favour of reviewing FP7 for these very reasons and also so that the EU can be more competitive in the field of research without having to wait for the Eighth Framework Programme.
The 'Lisbon strategy' of becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 may have failed, but this does not mean we should abandon it entirely.
The rapporteur rightly points out the failure of the goal set by the European Council in 2000 of becoming the most prevalent knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.
Canada is one of the EU's oldest and closest partners, being the first industrialised country with which - in 1976 - the EU signed a Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation.
By voting in favour of this resolution on the current trade negotiations between the EU and Canada, I wish to reiterate the importance of international trade (including with Canada) for developing our economies.
Canada is one of the EU's oldest and closest partners, being the first industrialised country with which - in 1976 - the EU signed a Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation.
A number of bilateral agreements designed to facilitate stronger trade relations have been signed over the years and currently, the EU is Canada's second most important trading partner and Canada's second largest source of foreign direct investment.
While I see no reason why the EU and Canada cannot trade freely, prior legislation has demonstrated the EU ambition is predisposed to usurp rather than parallel extant trade relationships between the UK and third countries.
As part of the ongoing negotiations on the trade agreement between the EU and Canada, the Commission must undertake to comply with the European Parliament's demands.
In a free trade agreement, two things are vital: first, ensuring reciprocity in respect of social and environmental legislation; second, adopting a consistent and protective approach to services of general interest.
Up to now, the Commission has negotiated free trade agreements by providing a 'positive' list, listing services covered by the agreement one by one.
Canada and the EU share a set of values, making us not just trade partners, but also natural allies in the global geostrategic situation.
To this end, and without questioning the role played by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), it is crucial to liberalise trade by concluding all negotiations under way within the framework of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), of which EU-Canada trade relations are part.
The EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement, like the others, also covers services and worthy, but inconsistent concerns are being expressed relating to 'negative lists' or others, which do not remove the threats also hanging over public services.
The agreements that give concrete expression to this policy are essentially based on free trade, whose goals and effects are clearly demonstrated by the associated rhetoric: that of so-called 'offensive interests', as if we were talking about a war.
In view of the fact that the European Union is Canada's second largest trade partner, and that Canada is a major partner for the EU in the field of foreign direct investment, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on EU-Canada trade relations.
The legal base is also questionable, as the European Parliament's legal opinion, dated 1 April 2009, shows: 'It seems virtually impossible to justify the ban on the sole basis of animal well-being, since the Treaty contains no legal basis on animal well-being'.
Finally, an embargo on which the Commission gives assurances that there would be no impact on Inuit traditional hunting is unrealistic.
In this context, the request submitted by Canada to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) concerning the creation of a special dispute settlement body in relation to the European embargo is justified.
Canada has no right to try and undermine the democratic will of European citizens by taking our clearly non-discriminatory seal ban law to the World Trade Organisation.
I believe that we should continue to make every effort to reach an agreement that suits everyone, since it will be very important for both sides' economic development.
For its part, in 1976, Canada became the first industrialised country with which the EU signed a framework agreement for commercial and economic cooperation, and it is the EU's fourth largest source of foreign direct investment.
The CETA is by far the most ambitious bilateral FTA the EU has ever negotiated under the 2006 'Global Europe' trade strategy.
I am not sure whether the rapporteur's proposal to establish a European Rating Agency is a sensible solution.
It is politically unacceptable and economically dangerous for these agencies, which have played such a negative role in the present crisis, to continue to have the right, granted by the EU itself, to rate not only companies, but also the economies of the Member States.
By no stretch of the imagination has the problem been resolved of ratings by self-seeking private firms, be they American now or European in the future, which alone foster the speculation mafia.
However, as Mr Klinz rightly points out, this business model risks drawing attention away from protecting investors and towards protecting debt issuers, unless suitable corrective measures are taken.
Although CRA ratings fulfil several useful purposes (for example, they aggregate information about the credit quality of issuers, which is particularly helpful in our global environment), developments in the regulatory framework have turned these 'information intermediaries' into de facto 'regulatory licensors', a mistake that we must not make!
There is an urgent need to review the role of these agencies for regulating the global financial market and find effective solutions for their lack of competition.
The truth is that the agencies gave the highest possible rating to many complex financial instruments, toxic instruments, as we were later to learn.
No one knows which market or which agency directs the reactions of the other; whether one country's poor rating triggers panic over sovereign debt, or whether cynical speculation leads to a poor rating; whether a good rating has an impact on certain assets being held onto or whether, because they are good and one wants to hold onto them, the assets are rated favourably.
There is no doubt that holding them legally and even financially accountable for the consequences of their mistakes and their irresponsible evaluations would have an impact.
Since the irresponsible behaviour of credit rating agencies (CRAs) has often been the initial cause of speculation that primarily harms European taxpayers, it is hugely important to review their role in sovereign debt ratings as part of the ongoing reform process, which will be completed in the autumn.
Consensus was also reached on the issue of transparency, since I support the idea to oblige all registered rating agencies to conduct an annual review to assess their past credit rating performances, with this information then being passed on to the supervisor.
It would therefore be beneficial to get a better picture of both the advantages and disadvantages of such a body with the aid of a detailed study.
We agree, in this vein, with the importance of more widespread information for investors and that market participants should only be authorised to invest in derivative financial instruments if they can prove to have an understanding and ability to assess the credit risk that the product carries.
If they are unable to do so, they are asked to apply the least favourable rating to offer themselves the greatest protection.
These should undergo the necessary impact assessments and scrutiny, and should not be a shot from the hip, which could be counterproductive, increasing the barriers to entry into the markets and the risk of more conservative ratings, with subsequent effects on the real economy and lending.
It is necessary to do our best not to repeat the situation which happened with Greece.
There is something terribly wrong with the system as a whole if the Greek irregularities and the Goldman-Sachs swap to conceal debt were known in the market for many years, if it was common for Athens to revise its budget data as soon as a new government came to power and the state was still given a good credit rating, only provoking a sudden, sharp response when the financial and economic crisis happened, causing bankruptcies, penalising states whose banks backed precarious loans, while, at the same time, betting a lot of money on countries going bankrupt.
This is not just because they do not identify risks in good time, as in the case of the US real estate market, but also because they can make a bad situation worse after a crisis occurs.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Klinz because I think it is essential for the European Union to have adequate rules to manage the impact of ratings on the overall financial and economic system. Notwithstanding the legal vacuum in this area and the possibility for these agencies to affect Member States' economies - even to the extent of plunging them into crises - this report does appear to be the first step towards new rules for rating agencies given the Commission's recent adoption of the new regulation on CRAs.
The report also fails to mention the withdrawal of sovereign debt from the agencies' ratings, which is the main measure that could be taken in this area to combat speculation against the euro.
I call on the rating agencies to shed further light on how they determine their sovereign ratings, while also asking the sector to explain their methodologies and why their ratings diverge from the forecasts of the main international financial institutions.
Agencies were also advising companies on ways to present their higher-risk products as low risk, and this misleading practice meant that these products turned out to be more toxic than their rating would suggest and led to huge losses for investors, including pension holders across Wales.
The protection of economic and social rights is an obligation for all Member States arising from the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
I voted in favour of this report because it also calls for a change in governance, globally and in the EU, in order to better implement workers' rights and working conditions.
However, as regards trade relations between the European Union and third countries, there remain profound differences in terms of social protection systems, as well as of working conditions.
I therefore voted for this report, which underlines the crucial role that the EU can play regarding human rights, especially through the right to a decent job.
This phenomenon is nevertheless associated with the risk that these countries - and, in particular, their companies - will export labour standards below those of the European Union.
I voted in favour of this report because there are still cases where the conventions and agreements of the International Labour Organisation are not properly implemented or only partially implemented and the principles of corporate social responsibility are violated.
This is because, in my opinion, the EU should refrain from imposing social prerogatives on third countries, however correct or beneficial they may deem them to be.
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) plays a key role in the international system, as it contributes to building a consensus on labour standards.
I therefore believe that this report is a fairly valid contribution to the development of the system of international trade, which is based on labour relations that vary so much between countries/trade blocs.
If these two factors are in balance, then this means, on the one hand, that people can do their work with adequate remuneration that is in line with human dignity and professional quality, while, on the other hand, it allows business owners to develop their businesses by following market principles, though tempered by the human environment in which this must take place.
Respect for International Labour Organisation standards, the principles laid down in the European Social Charter and social dialogue are just some of the areas that can be discussed on these occasions.
Given the globalisation of industry and services, international labour standards are the basis for guaranteeing that the growth of the global economy can benefit all.
The external dimension of the social policy is aimed at promoting core social standards in third countries in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations and to ensure that workers are protected through compliance with international labour standards.
The EU is far from being outdone and that is why it should be able to benefit from its credibility and its 'good reputation' in this regard, with a view to establishing social alliances with its main trading partners and promoting these at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and International Labour Organisation (ILO).
This is just an example of an aspect that the report could and should have taken much further.
When have we ever taken practical and specific action as a consequence of coming across situations of intolerable exploitation?
As the rapporteur - who subscribes to this - points out, 'labour standards should not be used for protectionist trade purposes' according to the international bodies!
Let me also disapprove of the fact that at paragraph 31, the report stresses that no European directive enforcing respect for corporate social responsibility should be adopted.
For this reason, I was keen to stress, through my vote, the need for the European Union to ensure that social standards and workers' rights are adhered to when signing agreements with these countries.
I welcomed this document because, at the turn of the century, the EU changed its strategy for the external dimension of social policy from a hard to a soft approach, i.e. from focusing on linking social standards with trade agreements to focusing rather on international cooperation and dialogue.
This is often hindered by the country's legal order; however, weak political will and internal economic pressure are also at play.
In order for the EU to negotiate with non-member countries, the latter must respect all the abovementioned.
Like the rapporteur, I regret that there is no single definition of a 'social clause' which would be usable not in bilateral trade agreements, but in the creation of decent employment conditions for workers.
Despite the above, I abstained from the vote because it is impossible to implement social demands in bilateral trade agreements in the absence of a clear definition of respect for human rights.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Falbr since it focuses precisely on the importance of safeguarding human rights and the fact that the European social model is an important starting point, including in terms of the Union's external relations.
This is a condition without which negotiations with third countries are impossible.
However, I would point out that these are lofty aims that will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in reality.
Although I am in favour of the principles behind the report, I do not believe its conclusions are absolutely correct, which is why I abstained from voting.
It is absolutely crucial for the European Commission to make adjustments for the current situation and realities of life in the country in question when negotiating partnership agreements.
The European Parliament has gained new competences since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and it should cooperate actively with European and international trade unions in order to improve the social situation.
This is a legitimate objective; however, I have certain reservations as to whether we shall be able to achieve this objective.
This report reminds us that, if the EU wishes to become a leader in the world in terms of social policy, it needs to safeguard cohesion between the social policies applied in its Member States.
In order for third countries to negotiate with the EU, they must respect all the ideas outlined above.
There are currently eight International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions that have been ratified by all EU Member States.
By insisting on better pay, the EU is also ensuring that there is a market in third party countries for EU exports.
As well as the fact that such rules are not binding and that there is no sanction if they are breached, it also risks reducing traditional supervisory systems in favour of informal monitoring procedures.
In an increasingly globalised world, it is essential that the EU make use of its international influence to ensure that workers' rights are protected in a model that respects personal dignity.
In order for the EU to negotiate with non-Member States, they must respect all the abovementioned issues.
A business may say that it is socially responsible when it commits to a robust structure that is capable of taking account not only of economic outcomes, but also of the social and environmental results of its actions.
These days, we ask not merely how businesses achieve their economic results, but also who they hire and how staff are treated.
I voted in favour of this resolution because it emphasises the pivotal role that the European Union wants and should play with respect to third countries, especially with the EU's trading partners.
This is one of the points I was keen to stress in the opinion of the Committee on International Trade on this issue, for which I was rapporteur.
The EU currently has the power to enter into trade agreements with third countries on behalf of all of the Member States of the EU.
However, as long as this remains the case, it will also be necessary to lay down requirements specifying what these trade agreements are to contain.
As the report explains, the EU enjoys a good worldwide reputation in terms of the ideal link between economic dynamism and a social model, which also gives rise to a certain responsibility.
There must be one objective for 2020: every young person must have a job.
With regret, I must also say that there is no comprehensive and all-inclusive approach shared by all Member States.
I voted in favour of this report because I agree that demographic changes and increasing longevity mean that working lives will be more varied, and retraining and participation in lifelong learning have already become a necessity.
I voted in favour of this report because, as it clearly points out, young people are the real resource of the future.
We need to work effectively and quickly in order to give some dignity back to these young people, who want to work and, above all, become part of a world in which they are unlikely to be accepted with open arms.
It is essential that the Member States adopt political strategies aimed at combating this problem that are based on the objectives set by the Europe 2020 strategy of reducing school drop-out rates to below 10% per year, and of enabling at least 40% of young people to complete higher education.
Unfortunately, I would say that the Europe 2020 strategy's ambitions are not visibly in harmony with the reality of budget restrictions, which have substantially cut funding for the main EU programmes in the area of education.
However, this requires the transposition of Union legislation in these areas, as this report warns.
However, we should be aware that more training often does not correspond to more opportunities in the labour market.
However, the report fundamentally emphasises the role of vocational training in promoting entrepreneurship and the need to 'create an environment where enterprises can succeed, develop and grow', adding that 'to grow, they need a reduced tax burden and predictability so they can plan and make investments'.
Europe's young people must be given the opportunity to compete with their contemporaries from the four corners of the globe.
I welcomed this document because Europe needs to take action immediately, especially where young people are concerned: rising youth unemployment is one of Europe's most pressing challenges.
in writing. - I would like to welcome this report which draws attention to the necessity of broadening the system of vocational training in the EU since equal access to quality lifelong learning means better chances in the labour market and thereby contributes to fulfilment of the goals of the EU's 2020 strategy.
These funds should, in fact, be increased, so that everyone, regardless of their age, gender or location, has access to the same opportunities in terms of vocational education and careers.
Ongoing dialogue between the world of vocational training and education and the labour market is more necessary than ever today.
In my opinion, this initiative is very important and timely.
Account is taken of specific challenges such as: the demand for ever-increasing qualifications by the labour market, which puts low-skilled jobs at risk, the spiralling increase in youth unemployment, which is over 30% in certain EU Member States, including Greece, and the failure on the part of the Member States to take adequate measures to achieve the targets set in the EU 2020 strategy (for example, to reduce the percentage of early school leavers to 10% and to increase the percentage of young people with a university education to 40%).
I agree with the rapporteur when she says that there is a need to breathe life into the Europe 2020 strategy.
The labour market increasingly requires mobile, flexible people with international experience.
In this respect, the idea of putting in place incentive mechanisms intended for employers so that they encourage their employees to participate in training programmes, suggested by Mrs Hirsch in this report, sounds interesting.
I voted for this report, since I think it is essential to have a long-term, EU-level strategy that also enables structural unemployment and youth unemployment to be tackled.
Especially important, as I personally have stated on several occasions, is the proposal to facilitate labour mobility within the framework of the Internal Market.
The mismatch between young people's qualifications and the needs of the labour market is one of the reasons why Lithuania has such a terribly high rate of youth unemployment (34%).
I supported Mr Mitchell's report because I believe we have to increase the participation of parliaments in developing countries when drawing up strategy papers for these countries, for the poverty eradication strategy for instance.
This position is incompatible with our political approach in which strengthening borders and combating illegal immigration are key priorities, and therefore we would argue that additional resources should be invested in this direction.
These principles have been clearly stated in the report in question, and I therefore voted in favour.
I believe the values that characterise European Parliament action, not least the promotion of democracy and the defence of human rights, can contribute positively to constructing a tool that is more compact, effective and comprehensive.
In my opinion, the way the report analyses this issue is quite interesting: it proposes new approaches that will now have to be debated over the coming months, specifically as regards the need for aid to developing countries that is more differentiated, dividing them into groups.
It is now evident that there is a need for Parliament to maintain democratic scrutiny of this financial instrument and future ones; it is even clearer how important it is becoming for developing countries' national parliaments to be involved in drafting strategic national documents linked to aid received from the Union.
I hope that aid levels will not decrease, but rather will increase wherever possible, and that ways for it to effectively benefit the most deprived populations will be studied.
The situations in developing countries should not all be approached in the same way, but rather in a more differentiated way, bearing in mind that traditional financial aid can become less important in many cases, for example, in the case of the so-called emerging countries.
I believe that the Mitchell report, which is an extremely good report, touches on many key issues, and I therefore decided to vote in favour of it.
I am also in favour of 'more' budgetary aid, whether general or sector-specific, and fewer projects whenever the macro-economic and governance criteria allow.
Attention should also be drawn to the fact that, when establishing a new financing instrument for developing countries alone, there must be a thorough analysis of the general objectives, the priority areas and expected results, as well as the allocation of funds.
I voted in favour of this motion so that the European Parliament has the possibility to exercise scrutiny over strategic programming decisions on an equal footing with the Council.
As such, Parliament should take on a more important role, not just because of the various ways that this confers democratic legitimacy, but also because of what it can offer in material and procedural terms.
It should also be stressed that the objective should be the eradication of poverty, by reference to the concept of 'basic social services', so as to seek to reduce the situation of extreme vulnerability of the most deprived populations.
It should be clarified, therefore, that development cooperation is the only EU external action policy which has not been designed to serve European Union interests, but to defend the interests of the most marginalised and vulnerable populations on this planet through poverty alleviation and sustainable human, social and economic development - in short, the right to a decent life for all.
Furthermore, it is particularly important for decisions on the general objectives, the priority areas and the allocation of funds to be taken using the delegated acts procedure, pursuant to Article 290 TFEU.
However, they can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator's democratic and legitimate decision-making process.
It is important for IAs to be completely independent and transparent and, moreover, the consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises should be taken into account.
Impact studies should be applied to all legislative proposals, they should have a clear methodology, and they should be undertaken with full independence and transparency.
For some time, the Commission has already been carrying out impact assessments of legislation before submitting legislative proposals to the European Parliament and the Council, but the report states that these impact assessment procedures still need to be greatly improved.
in writing. - Having worked on this area at Committee level before, I am obliged to stress the point that impact assessments must be free from outside interference and that this independence must be protected at all levels.
I therefore agree, in general, with Parliament's proposals in this report.
I am voting for this report because I share the rapporteur's view that IAs are crucial in order for us to carry out our work as law makers.
However, the current IA process has numerous failings, as the report acknowledges.
That is why it is very important to ensure that impact studies are independent.
Unfortunately, there have been accusations that regulations are also being created which result merely from the desire to make the EU institutions better known, or from the actions of lobbyists.
In my opinion, the proposal to modify impact assessments after the introduction of amendments by Parliament is very important, and I also share the opinion of those who believe that we need to apply uniform criteria for impact assessments in all the institutions.
At the same time, I would draw attention to the fact that the most crucial aspect of law making is the political will to resolve a given problem, and an impact assessment prepared as part of a particular project can merely supply objective information.
I have already had the opportunity to say in this House that it is time indeed that impact assessments be not only systematic, but, above all, credible.
Member States must therefore be closely involved in these studies because they are in a better position to assess the national impact of initiatives coming from Brussels.
The fourth and final section calls for an autonomous IA structure within the European Parliament which all of Parliament's committees should use to further improve law making and create synergies.
I would also like to call on the Commission to concentrate more, when performing impact assessments, on the transparency of the entire assessment process, to strive harder for its independence, and not to aim for just one solution to a problem in its proposals, but to assess multiple variant solutions to a specific situation independently.
I would also like to call for a simplification of the process of public consultations, and an extension of the deadlines for submitting concrete proposals, including the possibility of submitting proposals in all official languages of the Union.
However, I believe that recognition of their usefulness should always depend on respect for certain fundamental principles, such as transparency and independence.
We must also not forget the very important role played by Member States in impact assessment, as they must incorporate the proposed legislation into their legal systems.
Impact assessments are a key instrument for the legislative process, and one of which European legislators should make greater use in future, as they show the possible consequences of their policy options.
Potential for improvement at EP level: the main focus is the creation of an autonomous structure within the EP led by a supervisory board consisting of MEPs, possibly appointed at the beginning of each term, making use of the existing resources but also of seconded national experts.
Impact assessments make a significant technical contribution to better law making as they show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options.
The first section takes the view that the impact assessments used by the European institutions should comply with certain principles and should be completely independent and transparent.
The third section is devoted to the impact assessments carried out by the European Parliament, which its committees are invited to use more extensively in order to further improve law making.
The fourth and final section calls for an autonomous impact assessment structure within the European Parliament which all of Parliament's committees should use to create more synergies.
The specific consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises should be taken into account where appropriate and they must always be kept up to date with current developments in the legislative process.
Not only should impact assessments state the possibilities and make recommendations to legislators, they must also be prepared to recommend taking no action at all if it is considered to be the most appropriate course.
However, they must not just be promoted prior to a piece of legislation (ex ante), but also following its adoption (ex post).
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular SMEs, and consumers.
The most obvious obstacles which consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises face with regard to the Single Market are complex contractual relations, unfair terms and conditions in contracts, inadequate and insufficient information, time-consuming procedures, language barriers, different taxation systems, reliability of online traders, demographic composition of the population of individual Member States, concerns regarding confidentiality, complaint handling and intellectual property rights.
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, and consumers.
This would mean the end of national legal traditions and the laws that every Member State has laid down on issues as sensitive as civil and contract law.
In any case, although the objective of introducing an optional instrument is to facilitate cross-border trade, taking the needs of consumers and companies into due account, it must be borne in mind that existing European legislation already satisfies the needs of the various actors involved.
The divergence in contract law rights must be remedied, and the creation of an optional instrument for European contract law by means of a regulation, which would flank rather than replace Member States' national contract law systems, is an optimal solution that would give the parties the freedom to choose the legal instrument most suited to their needs.
We are therefore not indifferent to the potential linked to the existence of a common body of general standards and principles applicable to contract law, in terms of increasing cross-border transactions, of regulating e-commerce and of improving consumers' access to products.
However, and as argued by the rapporteur, I believe that an optional instrument for European contract law that exists alongside national legislation, but does not replace, is a suitable choice.
This issue has been current in the European Parliament since 1989, which led the Commission to draw up an action plan in 2003.
By selecting the right way forwards in the area of contract law, it is possible to contribute in a significant way to the better functioning of the Single Market and to making its full potential available to businesses (especially small and medium-sized ones) and consumers.
Bearing in mind the fact that every initiative in the area of contract law will have to respond clearly to the actual needs and problems of businesses and consumers, I take the view that any justification in this area will have to be based on practical evidence relating to the current situation in contract law and any difficulties encountered by businesses and consumers, particularly in cross-border transactions.
What Mrs Wallis is proposing is nothing short of creating a 28th legal system, in addition to national laws, which it intends to replace in practice; the words legislative 'harmonisation' and 'standardisation' are now feared in the European political context.
Hence, the proposal to establish a common European contract law, which would benefit consumers and help ensure increased cross-border trade within the Internal Market.
I abstained from voting because the EU recently adopted the Rome I Regulation, which regulates this area and defends consumer rights well, whereas this proposal is purely based on the UK situation and would only cause turbulence and increased bureaucracy.
The creation of this instrument is the first step towards the creation of a pan-European civil code, which would gradually replace the contract law of the individual Member States.
We should therefore stick to a standard instrument, for which there is sufficient legal support in primary law in the form of harmonisation.
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, and consumers.
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law could make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market, and to opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, and consumers.
This should not take the form of restrictive actions, such as those once familiar when bank accounts were overdrawn, but instead should combat shady business practices, fraud, etc.
It is open to question whether European contract law will improve market access for small enterprises because, according to analyses, it is mainly medium to large-sized retail businesses that are involved in cross-border trade, something that is due to the bureaucratic red tape entailed, as well as the costs.
When in doubt, I back the principle of subsidiarity, which is why I am voting against the Wallis report.
Until now, it has seemed as if European contract law was something unnecessary and the general principle applies that if a provision is not necessary, then it should be omitted.
I also believe that this report is a diversionary tactic, designed to draw attention away from the fact that something far more important, namely, EU-wide consumer protection, is still in need of improvement.
It is for that reason that I am voting against this report.
Mrs Wallis's motion for a resolution favours the creation of an optional instrument for European contract law for consumers and businesses by virtue of a general regulation, and this is why I voted in favour of the text.
Furthermore, the instrument would not replace Member States' contract laws, but would merely help ensure a better choice of contract model between the parties, thanks to examples based on general principles, definitions and model regulations for both commercial and consumer contracts, without going against the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law could make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market, and to opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and consumers.
According to a Flash Eurobarometer survey in 2008, this barrier is seen as a major concern by up to 60% of retailers.
On the other, however, there is a certain resistance amongst Member States to sacrificing their legal solutions, which is hardly surprising given that these have developed over centuries and that they are widely known by their respective populations.
Within this framework, Mrs Wallis's report is a move in the right direction: it refers to the adverse impact which differences in contract law within the Internal Market are having both on consumers and on businesses, and to the benefits to the Internal Market of an improved contract law framework.
I therefore also believe that an optional instrument, or a '28th legal regime', stands a good chance of helping to unlock the potential of the European market in the field of e-commerce, and of helping to expand the market for entrepreneurs while guaranteeing equal access to goods and services for consumers.
It is therefore important to develop a tool to complement GDP.
Hence, the importance of this resolution which insists on the need for the European Union to adopt other indicators in addition to GDP in order to take better account of, among other things, climate change, biodiversity or even social integration, these being major political challenges that are close to my heart.
The initiatives suggested are not, in fact, part of a tiered, pragmatic strategy indicating how the new 'Beyond GDP' approach should be used.
I voted for this report because I believe that it is only by using proper instruments that we can have a realistic view of the situation, and therefore do our best to change it if necessary.
As Joseph Stiglitz expressed it so well, GDP is not only an instrument which is inadequate for reflecting citizens' welfare, but it is also restricted to measuring economic market activity.
I hope that the European executive will come up with specific proposals for additional, more extensive and sustainable indicators so as to remedy the current shortcomings.
However, it should be complemented, wherever appropriate, with other indicators, which should be studied and introduced gradually.
A number of sociologists have been arguing, most recently, that this is not the best indicator as it does not consider aspects such as sustainability or social integration.
Since I agree with the rapporteur's position, I voted for her report, but I believe that the proposal can, and must, be improved by tabling a strategy that is more comprehensive and gradual.
We agree with the rapporteur that it is necessary to submit a tiered strategy that should show how the new approach can be used pragmatically in day-to-day political work.
However, its universality raises doubts as to whether it fails to take into account a series of indicators which are crucial for quality of life in a given country.
The Commission has suggested that it is essential to develop an indicator which clearly depicts the situation in the country in question, and which also reflects the situation of households and individuals, as well as how efficiently the country's resources are exploited and the state of the environment.
As the report rightly says, gross domestic product (GDP), which is used by political decision makers worldwide and referred to in public debates, has also come to take on the role of a comprehensive indicator for overall societal development and progress in general.
For the above reasons, and in order to be able to develop a clear and comprehensive set of indicators that are, at the same time, consistent, relevant and objectively measurable, I voted for the motion being discussed.
I voted for this report because it is important that we develop a tool which can complement GDP, taking into account that it has to be done in a way so that it can have practical use, based on clearly defined indicators and high-quality data.
Consequently, new indicators need to be developed, which is precisely what Mrs Rosbach's report does.
I consider that GDP is a limited indicator and that indicators should be developed to supplement it.
In Lithuania, and at EU level, there is often a lack of clear information, data and indicators, and I therefore support the rapporteur's proposal to provide a better report on social indicators.
Faced with this situation, it is essential that we consider new solutions.
I agree that there should be a broad and comprehensive debate at political level about the desired level of ambition (deciding the level of services provided) and the financial resources available (whereby a political choice would need to be made between a purely EU funded programme and one allowing national or private contributions).
in writing. - At a time when the Commission, and indeed this Parliament, ought to be searching for, and bringing forward, proposals on how to save money, we are offered this report which suggests the completion of the Galileo satellite navigation system at an additional cost of EUR 1.9 billion in the next Multiannual Financial Framework.
At a time when countries like Portugal are resorting to aid from the other Member States, and when Europe is, as such, facing a serious economic and financial crisis that threatens its stability, an even greater effort should be made to avoid cost overruns and excessive expense.
I voted in favour of the rapporteur's proposals, in spite of the cost overruns recorded in the implementation of the project, because I understand that the EU should be at the forefront of researching and developing cutting-edge technology, especially when that same technology represents a scientific and economic asset to the EU.
These applications also represent the growing global markets from which the EU will benefit financially.
I voted in favour of Mrs Ţicău's report because the project under examination meets many expectations of those looking to developments in research and technology with optimism.
I voted for this resolution which, while praising the technical success, reminds the European Commission of the points where the programme can be improved: funding, public awareness, and involving our international partners.
It is very important, however, that continuity of service is guaranteed, as a (temporary) limitation or degradation of GPS signals will have tremendous effects on our economy and society, without other independent GNSS systems in place.
However, problems arise here when the associated cuts in services only affect the citizens of Europe as taxpayers, only leaving services for military use untouched.
The Galileo idea is a good one in principle; however, the costs must be brought under control.
Unfortunately, it seems as if these cuts will only affect the European taxpayer as they will result in reductions in services.
As it is not clear how much the Galileo system will cost the taxpayer, I abstained on this measure, not least to reiterate the request to the Commission to clarify the project's future costs.
In this context, I think it is important, as the rapporteur suggests, to launch the debate about the structure of this programme and how to make money out of it in future, so as to adopt robust and safe solutions for the future of Europe.
I support the rapporteur that with the rejection of the option of freezing the resources, as proposed by five Heads of Government in December 2010 (France, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Finland), the European Parliament is sending a strong political signal for the negotiations between the 27 Member States, due to start after the official presentation of the European Commission proposal expected on 29 June.
The report stresses very clearly that without sufficient additional resources in the post-2013 MFF, the Union will not be able to fulfil the existing policy priorities, linked, in particular, to the Europe 2020 strategy, or the new tasks provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon, let alone respond to unforeseen events.
I voted in favour of this excellent report by my colleague, Mr Garriga Polledo, as it provides an extremely good presentation of the budget that the European Union will need after 2013 to respond to the political challenges it will face.
The failed Lisbon strategy shows where we will end up if we base our strategy on matters over which the EU has no say.
'Cut your coat according to your cloth' is a better suggestion than this undesirable call for more and new resources.
